What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.</p>

<p>For example, if I have a <code>Word</code> class, I will write some unit tests for the <code>Word</code> class.  Then, I begin writing my <code>Sentence</code> class, and when it needs to interact with the <code>Word</code> class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both <code>Sentence</code> and <code>Word</code>... at least in the places where they interact.</p>

<p><em>Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?</em></p>

<p>In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature?</p>

<p>Am I misunderstanding integration tests, or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests?</p>

<hr>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>Thanks for all the great responses everyone!  I think from the varied answers it's clear that the line between unit and integration tests is definitely a blurry line, and perhaps it's a bit pedantic to try and figure out which are which and the true focus should stay on the code (Thanks @Rob Cooper).  Also, sorry but I'm not going to accept any answer because too many are too good, and it really seems quite subjective.</p>

<p>We’re using a Gentoo server.  We recently upgraded to PHP version 5.6.  It was after the upgrade when this problem appeared.    </p>

<p>I found when I replace the REST service with an address like <code>https://www.google.com</code>; my page works just fine.  </p>

<p>In an earlier attempt I set <code>“verify_peer”=&gt;false</code>, and passed that in as an argument to file_get_contents, as described here:  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15076819/file-get-contents-ignoring-verify-peer-false"">file_get_contents ignoring verify_peer=&gt;false?</a>  But like the writer noted; it made no difference.  </p>

<p>I’ve asked one of our server administrators if these lines in our php.ini file exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>extension=php_openssl.dll</li>
<li>allow_url_fopen = On</li>
</ul>

<p>He told me that since we’re on Gentoo, openssl is compiled when we build; and it’s not set in the php.ini file.  </p>

<p>I also confirmed that <code>allow_url_fopen</code> is working.  Due to the specialized nature of this problem; I’m not finding a lot of information for help.  Have any of you come across something like this?  Thanks.  </p>

<p>I understand that the <code>return_val</code> will be an rvalue at the point the function returns and can therefore be returned using move semantics, which are very cheap.

This is because a <code>std::string</code> has various components including a pointer into the heap and a member <code>char[]</code> for short string optimization.  So it seems to me that passing by reference is still a good idea.</p>

<p>I've tried using CATransaction to turn off actions and set the duration to zero, and neither work. Here's the code I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>[CATransaction begin];
[CATransaction setDisableActions: YES];
[self setNeedsDisplayInRect: rect];
[CATransaction commit];
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a different method on CATransaction I should use instead (I also tried -setValue:forKey: with kCATransactionDisableActions, same result).</p>

On the other hand, there are also lots of big Python web applications, but beside of Zope (which I've heard should be really horrible to code) IoC doesn't seem to be very common in the Python world. (Please name some examples if you think that I'm wrong).</p>

<p>There are of course several clones of popular Java IoC frameworks available for Python, <a href=""http://springpython.webfactional.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">springpython</a> for example. But none of them seems to get used practically.

<p>In my opinion IoC has reasonable advantages and would make it easy to replace the django-default-user-model for example, but extensive usage of interface classes and IoC in Python looks a bit odd and not »pythonic«. But maybe someone has a better explanation, why IoC isn't widely used in Python.</p>

I have a Service that will run in the background and do some gps and time based logging. I will have an Activity that will be used to start and stop the Service. </p>

<p>So first, I need to be able to figure out if the Service is running when the Activity is started. There are some other questions here about that, so I think I can figure that out (but feel free to offer advice).</p>

<p>My real problem: if the Activity is running and the Service is started, I need a way for the Service to send messages to the Activity. Simple Strings and integers at this point - status messages mostly. The messages will not happen regularly, so I don't think polling the service is a good way to go if there is another way. I only want this communication when the Activity has been started by the user - I don't want to start the Activity from the Service. In other words, if you start the Activity and the Service is running, you will see some status messages in the Activity UI when something interesting happens. If you don't start the Activity, you will not see these messages (they're not that interesting).</p>

<p>It seems like I should be able to determine if the Service is running, and if so, add the Activity as a listener. Then remove the Activity as a listener when the Activity pauses or stops. Is that actually possible? The only way I can figure out to do it is to have the Activity implement Parcelable and build an AIDL file so I can pass it through the Service's remote interface. That seems like overkill though, and I have no idea how the Activity should implement writeToParcel() / readFromParcel().</p>

<p>Is there an easier or better way? Thanks for any help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p>For anyone who's interested in this later on, there is sample code from Google for handling this via AIDL in the samples directory: /apis/app/RemoteService.java</p>

The general premise is that there is some row in a <code>ListView</code> (whether it's generated by the adapter, or added as a header view) that contains an <code>EditText</code> widget and a <code>Button</code>.  All I want to do is be able to use the jogball/arrows, to navigate the selector to individual items like normal, but when I get to a particular row -- even if I have to explicitly identify the row -- that has a focusable child, I want that child to take focus instead of indicating the position with the selector.</p>

<p>I've tried many possibilities, and have so far had no luck.</p>

<p>layout:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView
    android:id=""@android:id/list"" 
    android:layout_height=""fill_parent"" 
    android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
    /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Header view:</p>

<pre><code>EditText view = new EditText(this);
listView.addHeaderView(view, null, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming there are other items in the adapter, using the arrow keys will move the selection up/down in the list, as expected;  but when getting to the header row, it is also displayed with the selector, and no way to focus into the <code>EditText</code> using the jogball.  Note: tapping on the <code>EditText</code> <em>will</em> focus it at that point, however that relies on a touchscreen, which should not be a requirement.</p>

<p><code>ListView</code> apparently has two modes in this regard:<br>
1. <code>setItemsCanFocus(true)</code>: selector is never displayed, but the <code>EditText</code> can get focus when using the arrows.  Focus search algorithm is hard to predict, and no visual feedback (on any rows: having focusable children or not) on which item is selected, both of which can give the user an unexpected experience.<br>
2. <code>setItemsCanFocus(false)</code>: selector is always drawn in non-touch-mode, and <code>EditText</code> can never get focus -- even if you tap on it.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, calling <code>editTextView.requestFocus()</code> returns true, but in fact does not give the EditText focus.</p>

<p>What I'm envisioning is basically a hybrid of 1 &amp; 2, where rather than the list setting if <em>all</em> items are focusable or not, I want to set focusability for a <em>single</em> item in the list, so that the selector seamlessly transitions from selecting the entire row for non-focusable items, and traversing the focus tree for items that contain focusable children.</p>

<p>Any takers?</p>

<p>The easiest way to repro it is by starting a Windows Forms application, add a button and write this code:</p>

<pre><code>    private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        MessageBox.Show(""yada"");
        Environment.Exit(1);         // Kaboom!
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The program fails <em>after</em> the Exit() statement executes. On Windows Forms  you get ""Error creating window handle"".</p>

<p>Enabling unmanaged debugging makes it somewhat clear what's going on. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model"" rel=""noreferrer"">COM</a> modal loop is executing and allows a WM_PAINT message to be delivered. That's fatal on a disposed form.</p>

<p>The only facts I've gathered so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It isn't just limited to running with the debugger.  This also fails without one.  Rather poorly as well, the WER crash dialog shows up <em>twice</em>.</li>
<li>It doesn't have anything to do with the bitness of the process. The wow64 layer is pretty notorious, but an AnyCPU build crashes the same way.</li>
<li>It doesn't have anything to do with the .NET version, 4.5 and 3.5 crash the same way.</li>
<li>The exit code doesn't matter.</li>
<li>Calling Thread.Sleep() before calling Exit() doesn't fix it.</li>
<li>This happens on the 64-bit version of Windows 8, and Windows 7 does not seem to be affected the same way.</li>
<li>This should be relatively new behavior, I haven't seen this before.  I see no relevant updates delivered through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Update"" rel=""noreferrer"">Windows Update</a>, albeit that the update history isn't accurate on my machine any more.</li>
<li>This is grossly breaking behavior. You would write code like this in an event handler for AppDomain.UnhandledException, and it crashes the same way.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm particularly interested in what you could possibly do to avoid this crash.  Particularly the AppDomain.UnhandledException scenario stumps me; there are not a lot of ways to terminate a .NET program.  Please do note that calling Application.Exit() or Form.Close() are not valid in an event handler for UnhandledException, so they are not workarounds.</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE: Mehrdad pointed out that the finalizer thread could be part of the problem.  I think I'm seeing this and am also seeing some evidence for the 2 second timeout that the CLR gives the finalizer thread to finish executing.</p>

<p>The finalizer is inside NativeWindow.ForceExitMessageLoop().  There's an IsWindow() Win32 function there that roughly corresponds with the code location, offset 0x3c when looking at the machine code in 32-bit mode.  It seems that IsWindow() is deadlocking.  I cannot get a good stack trace for the internals however, the debugger thinks the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_Invocation_Services"" rel=""noreferrer"">P/Invoke</a> call just returned.  This is hard to explain.  If you can get a better stack trace then I'd love to see it.  Mine:</p>

<pre><code>System.Windows.Forms.dll!System.Windows.Forms.NativeWindow.ForceExitMessageLoop() + 0x3c bytes

If this solution doesn't work for you, you are probably having a different issue (which belongs in a separate question).</em></p>

<hr>

<p>This is a question asked before, both here on Stack Overflow and other places, but none of the suggestions I've found this far has helped me, so I just have to try asking a new question.</p>

<p>Scenario: I have a simple Windows Forms application (C#, .NET 4.0, Visual Studio 2010). It has a couple of base forms that most other forms inherit from, it uses Entity Framework (and POCO classes) for database access. Nothing fancy, no multi-threading or anything.</p>

<p>Problem: All was fine for a while. Then, all out of the blue, Visual Studio failed to build when I was about to launch the application. I got the warning <em>""Unable to delete file '...bin\Debug\[ProjectName].exe'. Access to the path '...bin\Debug\[ProjectName].exe' is denied.""</em> and the error <em>""Unable to copy file 'obj\x86\Debug\[ProjectName].exe' to 'bin\Debug\[ProjectName].exe'. The process cannot access the file 'bin\Debug\[ProjectName].exe' because it is being used by another process.""</em> (I get both the warning and the error when running Rebuild, but only the error when running Build - don't think that is relevant?)</p>

<p>I understand perfectly fine what the warning and error message says: Visual Studio is obviously trying to overwrite the exe-file while it the same time has a lock on it for some reason. However, this doesn't help me find a solution to the problem... The only thing I've found working is to shut down Visual Studio and start it again. Building and launching then works, untill I make a change in some of the forms, then I have the same problem again and have to restart... Quite frustrating!</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, this seems to be a known problem, so there are lots of suggested solutions. I'll just list what I've already tried here, so people know what to skip:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a new clean solution and just copy the files from the old solution.</li>
<li><p>Adding the following to the following to the project's pre-build event:</p>

<pre><code>if exist ""$(TargetPath).locked"" del ""$(TargetPath).locked""
   if not exist ""$(TargetPath).locked"" if exist ""$(TargetPath)"" move ""$(TargetPath)"" ""$(TargetPath).locked""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Adding the following to the project properties (.csproj file):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;GenerateResourceNeverLockTypeAssemblies&gt;true&lt;/GenerateResourceNeverLockTypeAssemblies&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>However, none of them worked for me, so you can probably see why I'm starting to get a bit frustrated. I don't know where else to look, so I hope somebody has something to give me! Is this a bug in VS, and if so is there a patch? Or has I done something wrong, do I have a circular reference or similar, and if so how could I find out?</p>

<p>Any suggestions are highly appreciated :)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As mentioned in comment below, I've also checked using Process Explorer that it actually <em>is</em> Visual Studio that is locking the file.</p>

<p>Where <code>S(y_i)</code> is the softmax function of <code>y_i</code> and <code>e</code> is the exponential and <code>j</code> is the no. of columns in the input vector Y.</p>

For one, it picked up unwanted text, such as JavaScript source.  Also, it did not interpret HTML entities.  For example, I would expect &amp;#39; in HTML source to be converted to an apostrophe in text, just as if I'd pasted the browser content into notepad.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> <code>html2text</code> looks promising. It handles HTML entities correctly and ignores JavaScript.  However, it does not exactly produce plain text; it produces markdown that would then have to be turned into plain text. It comes with no examples or documentation, but the code looks clean.</p>

<p>So in this example, when you ask if:</p>

<pre><code>a.compareTo(b) &gt; 0
</code></pre>

<p>you might be asking if a's last name comes before b's, or if a is older than b, etc...</p>

<p>What is the cleanest way to enable multiple comparison between these kinds of objects without adding unnecessary clutter or overhead?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>java.lang.Comparable</code> interface allows comparison by one field only</li>
<li>Adding numerous compare methods (i.e. <code>compareByFirstName()</code>, <code>compareByAge()</code>, etc...) is cluttered in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p>So what is the best way to go about this?</p>

Doing so allows you to use Interface Builder to design your cells. The answer apparently is not simple due to memory managment issues. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/134575/using-interface-builder-for-uitableviews"">This thread</a> mentions the issue and suggests a solution, but is pre NDA-release and lacks code. Here's a <a href=""http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=8040526&amp;tstart=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">long thread</a> that discusses the issue without providing a definitive answer. </p>

<p>Here's some code I've used:</p>

<pre><code>static NSString *CellIdentifier = @""MyCellIdentifier"";

MyCell *cell = (MyCell *)[tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];
if (cell == nil) {
    NSArray *nib = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:CellIdentifier owner:self options:nil];
    cell = (MyCell *)[nib objectAtIndex:0];
}
</code></pre>

<p>To use this code, create MyCell.m/.h, a new subclass of <code>UITableViewCell</code> and add <code>IBOutlets</code> for the components you want. Then create a new ""Empty XIB"" file. Open the Xib file in IB, add a <code>UITableViewCell</code> object, set its identifier to ""MyCellIdentifier"", and set its class to MyCell and add your components. Finally, connect the <code>IBOutlets</code> to the components. Note that we did not set the File's Owner in IB.</p>

<p>Other methods advocate setting the File's Owner and warn of memory leaks if the Xib is not loaded via an additional factory class. I tested the above under Instruments/Leaks and saw no memory leaks. </p>

<p>So what's the canonical way to load cells from Xibs? Do we set File's Owner? Do we need a factory? If so, what's the code for the factory look like? If there are multiple solutions, let's clarify the pros and cons of each of them...</p>

<p>I ask because I am using a third party library that's in active development.

This is important because even though the 0.6.x branch is available, the devs are still releasing patches and bugfixes to the 0.5.x branch, so I don't want to use a static <code>package=0.5.9</code> line in my requirements file.</p>

Each texture unit can have multiple texture targets (usually GL_TEXTURE_1D, 2D, 3D or CUBE_MAP).</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, you have to call <code>glActiveTexture</code> to set the texture unit first (initialized to <code>GL_TEXTURE0</code>), and then you bind (one or more) ""texture targets"" to that texture unit?</p>

<p>The number of texture units available is system dependent. I see enums for up to 32 in my library. I guess this essentially means I can have the lesser of my GPU's limit (which I think is <del>16</del> 8) and 32 textures in GPU memory at any one time? I guess there's an additional limit that I don't exceed my GPU's maximum memory (supposedly 1 GB).</p>

<p>Am I understanding the relationship between texture targets and texture units correctly? Let's say I'm allowed 16 units and 4 targets each, does that mean there's room for 16*4=64 targets, or does it not work like that?</p>

<p>Next you typically want to load a texture. You can do this via <code>glTexImage2D</code>. The first argument of which is a texture target. If this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/8691709/65387"">works like <code>glBufferData</code></a>, then we essentially bind the ""handle""/""texture name"" to the texture target, and then load the texture data into that target, and thus indirectly associate it with that handle.</p>

<p>What about <code>glTexParameter</code>? We have to bind a texture target, and then choose that same target again as the first argument? Or does the texture target not need to be bound as long as we have the correct active texture unit?</p>

<p><code>glGenerateMipmap</code> operates on a target too...that target has to still be bound to the texture name for it to succeed?</p>

<p>Then when we want to draw our object with a texture on it, do we have to <em>both</em> choose an active texture unit, and then a texture target? Or do we choose a texture unit, and then we can grab data from any of the 4 targets associated with that unit? This is the part that's really confusing me.</p>

<p>For small to moderate size models, the 12GB of the Titan X are usually enough for 2-3 people to run training concurrently on the same GPU. If the models are small enough that a single model does not take full advantage of all the computational units of the Titan X, this can actually result in a speedup compared with running one training process after the other. Even in cases where the concurrent access to the GPU does slow down the individual training time, it is still nice to have the flexibility of having several users running things on the GPUs at once.</p>

<ul>
<li>m_<em>memberName</em> for public members (where public members are used at all)</li>
<li>_<em>memberName</em> for private members or all members</li>

<p>Others try to enforce using this-><em>member</em> whenever a member variable is used.</p>

<p>In my experience, most larger code bases fail at applying such rules consistently.</p>

<p>In other languages, these conventions are far less widespread. I see it only occasionally in Java or C# code. I think I have never seen it in Ruby or Python code. Thus, there seems to be a trend with more modern languages to not use special markup for member variables.</p>

<p>Is this convention still useful today in C++ or is it just an anachronism. Especially as it is used so inconsistently across libraries. Haven't the other languages shown that one can do without member prefixes?</p>

<p>The question is, why is immutability so important? What is wrong in mutating objects? Doesn't it make things simple?</p>

How do I achieve in this case? Delete the store and recreate it?
Isn't adding an object to the array a less expensive operation?</p>

<p>Case in point: One of our state customers recently found out that the browser provides the handy feature to save your password.

However, there is a bit of an uproar at the moment and we are being demanded to find a way to disable that functionality for our site.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Is there a way for a site to tell the browser not to offer to remember passwords? I've been around web development a long time but don't know that I have come across that before.</p>

That being said, one issue we are running into is that after we push out an update with new JavaScript files, the client browsers still use the cached version of the file and they do not see the update.  Obviously, on a support call, we can simply inform them to do a <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd> refresh to ensure that they get the up-to-date files from the server, but it would be preferable to handle this before that time.</p>

<p>Our current thought is to simply attach a version number onto the name of the JavaScript files and then when changes are made, increment the version on the script and update all references.  This definitely gets the job done, but updating the references on each release could get cumbersome.</p>

<p>As I'm sure we're not the first ones to deal with this, I figured I would throw it out to the community.  How are you ensuring clients update their cache when you update your code?  If you're using the method described above, are you using a process that simplifies the change?</p>

<p>So, lets say, you have a column called <code>name</code> of type <code>varchar</code>. So, you have to choose the length. I cannot think of a name > 20 chars, but you will never know. But instead of using 20, I always round up to the next 2^n number. In this case, I would choose 32 as the length. I do that, because from an computer scientist point of view, a number 2^n looks more <code>even</code> to me than other numbers and I'm just assuming that the architecture underneath can handle those numbers slightly better than others.</p>

<p>On the other hand, MSSQL server for example, sets the default length value to 50, when you choose to create a varchar column. That makes me thinking about it. Why 50? is it just a random number, or based on average column length, or what?</p>

<p>It could also be - or probably is - that different SQL servers implementations (like MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, ...) have different best column length values.</p>

<li>Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl. </li>
</ol>

<p>The pseudocode would look like this:</p>

<p><strong>CODE 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to ""MyName"".
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The Exception it gave was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code</p>

<p><strong>CODE 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == ""MyName"") // Now it wont give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to ""MyName""
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>BUT BUT BUT... it seems I'm back to square one. The Application again 
become nonresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.</p>

<p>I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading.</p>

<p>How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?</p>

<p><strong>The situation is this</strong>: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don't want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I'm not going to do it ever from a child thread. </p>

<p>So only accessing the value so that the corresponding data can be fetched from the database.</p>

That is kind of good, because the stack tells me how deep the recursion is. However, the optimization would be kind of nice as well.</p>

<p>Do any C++ compilers do this optimization? Why? Why not?</p>

<p>How do I go about telling the compiler to do it?</p>

<ul>
<li>For MSVC: /O2 or /Ox</li>
<li>For GCC: -O2 or -O3</li>
</ul>

<p>How about checking if the compiler has done this in a certain case?</p>

<ul>
<li>For MSVC, enable PDB output to be able to trace the code, then inspect the code</li>
<li>For GCC..?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd still take suggestions for how to determine if a certain function is optimized like this by the compiler (even though I find it reassuring that Konrad tells me to assume it)</p>

<p>It is always possible to check if the compiler does this at all by making an infinite recursion and checking if it results in an infinite loop or a stack overflow (I did this with GCC and found out that -O2 is sufficient), but I want to be able to check a certain function that I know will terminate anyway. I'd love to have an easy way of checking this :)</p>

<hr>

<p>After some testing, I discovered that destructors ruin the possibility of making this optimization. It can sometimes be worth it to change the scoping of certain variables and temporaries to make sure they go out of scope before the return-statement starts.</p>

<p>If any destructor needs to be run after the tail-call, the tail-call optimization can not be done.</p>

<p>Perhaps a solution where the server processes the user defined function and then generates a callback to be executed on the client would work? Even if that approach works are there better ways to solve this problem?</p>

<p>It is confusing for me in both ways. How am I supposed to have a code section that does not belong to any method? How is it possible to invoke it? In general, what is the purpose of this usage? Or better, where can I find documentation about this?</p>

<p>Searching for this error tells me to use the full namespace in the contract. Here's my app.config with full namespace:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;client&gt;
  &lt;endpoint address=""http://192.168.100.87:7001/soap/IMySOAPWebService""
            binding=""basicHttpBinding"" bindingConfiguration=""IMySOAPWebServicebinding""
            contract=""Fusion.DataExchange.Workflows.IMySOAPWebService"" name=""IMySOAPWebServicePort"" /&gt;
&lt;/client&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm running XP local (I mention this because a number of Google hits mention win2k3)
The app.config is copied to app.exe.config, so that is also not the problem.</p>

<p>Any clues?</p>

<p>By ""proper"" I mean that if my parent element is <code>200px</code> tall and I specify <code>height = 100%</code> with <code>padding = 5px</code> I would expect that I should get a <code>190px</code> high element with <code>border = 5px</code> on all sides, nicely centered in the parent element.</p>

<p>Now, I know that that's not how the standard box model specifies it should work (although I'd like to know why, exactly...), so the obvious answer doesn't work:</p>

<pre class=""lang-css prettyprint-override""><code>#myDiv {
    width: 100%
    height: 100%;
    padding: 5px;
}

<p>But it would seem to me that there must be SOME way of reliably producing this effect for a parent of arbitrary size. Does anyone know of a way of accomplishing this (seemingly simple) task?</p>

<p>Oh, and for the record I'm not terribly interested in IE compatibility so that should (hopefully) make things a bit easier. </p>

        &lt;div style=""background-color: black; height: 100%; padding: 25px""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The challenge is then to get the black box to show up with a 25 pixel padding on all edges without the page growing big enough to require scrollbars.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a tuple</h3>

<p>Consider this trivial example:</p>

<pre><code>def f(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return (y0,y1,y2)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this quickly gets problematic as the number of values returned increases. What if you want to return four or five values? Sure, you could keep tupling them, but it gets easy to forget which value is where. It's also rather ugly to unpack them wherever you want to receive them.</p>

<h3>Option: Using a dictionary</h3>

<p>The next logical step seems to be to introduce some sort of 'record notation'. In python, the obvious way to do this is by means of a <code>dict</code>. </p>

<p>Consider the following:</p>

<pre><code>def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return {'y0':y0, 'y1':y1 ,'y2':y2 }
</code></pre>

<p>(edit- Just to be clear, y0, y1 and y2 are just meant as abstract identifiers. As pointed out, in practice you'd use meaningful identifiers)</p>

<p>Now, we have a mechanism whereby we can project out a particular member of the returned object. For example, </p>

<pre><code>result['y0']
</code></pre>

<h3>Option: Using a class</h3>

<p>However, there is another option. We could instead return a specialized structure. I've framed this in the context of Python, but I'm sure it applies to other languages as well. Indeed, if you were working in C this might very well be your only option. Here goes:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2

def g(x):
  y0 = x + 1
  y1 = x * 3
  y2 = y0 ** y3
  return ReturnValue(y0, y1, y2)
</code></pre>

<p>In python the previous two are perhaps very similar in terms of plumbing- After all <code>{ y0, y1, y2 }</code> just end up being entries in the internal <code>__dict__</code> of the <code>ReturnValue</code>.</p>

<p>There is one additional feature provided by Python though for tiny objects, the <code>__slots__</code> attribute. The class could be expressed as:</p>

<pre><code>class ReturnValue(object):
  __slots__ = [""y0"", ""y1"", ""y2""]
  def __init__(self, y0, y1, y2):
     self.y0 = y0
     self.y1 = y1
     self.y2 = y2
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/pylang/__slots__.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Python Reference Manual</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>__slots__</code> declaration takes a sequence of instance variables and reserves just enough space in each instance to hold a value for each variable. Space is saved because <code>__dict__</code> is not created for each instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Option: Using a list</h3>

<p>Another suggestion which I'd overlooked comes from Bill the Lizard:</p>

<pre><code>def h(x):
  result = [x + 1]
  result.append(x * 3)
  result.append(y0 ** y3)
  return result
</code></pre>

<p>This is my least favorite method though. I suppose I'm tainted by exposure to Haskell, but the idea of mixed-type lists has always felt uncomfortable to me. In this particular example the list is -not- mixed type, but it conceivably could be. A list used in this way really doesn't gain anything with respect to the tuple as far as I can tell. The only real difference between lists and tuples in Python is that lists are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutable</a>, wheras tuples are not. I personally tend to carry over the conventions from functional programming: use lists for any number of elements of the same type, and tuples for a fixed number of elements of predetermined types.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>After the lengthy preamble, comes the inevitable question. Which method (do you think) is best?</p>

<p>I've typically found myself going the dictionary route because it involves less set-up work. From a types perspective however, you might be better off going the class route, since that may help you avoid confusing what a dictionary represents. On the other hand, there are some in the Python community that feel <a href=""http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/isinstance/"" rel=""noreferrer"">implied interfaces should be preferred to explicit interfaces</a>, at which point the type of the object really isn't relevant, since you're basically relying on the convention that the same attribute will always have the same meaning. </p>

<p>So, how do -you- return multiple values in Python?</p>

  header('Location: https://www.example.com/some-page.php');

So far I really like what I see in Spring MVC, seems very easy to use and encourages you to write classes that are very unit test-friendly.</p>

<p>Just as an exercise, I'm writing a main method for one of my sample/test projects. One thing I'm unclear about is the exact differences between <code>BeanFactory</code> and <code>ApplicationContext</code> - which is appropriate to use in which conditions?</p>

<p>I understand that <code>ApplicationContext</code> extends <code>BeanFactory</code>, but if I'm just writing a simple main method, do I need the extra functionality that <code>ApplicationContext</code> provides? And just exactly what kind of extra functionality does <code>ApplicationContext</code> provide?</p>

<p>In addition to answering ""which should I use in a main() method"", are there any standards or guidelines as far as which implementation I should use in such a scenario? Should my main() method be written to depend on the bean/application configuration to be in XML format - is that a safe assumption, or am I locking the user into something specific?</p>

<p>And does this answer change in a web environment - if any of my classes needed to be aware of Spring, are they more likely to need <code>ApplicationContext</code>?</p>

-L/usr/lib -lmagic
</code></pre>

<p>ld complains:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lmagic
</code></pre>

<p>However, libmagic exists:</p>

<pre><code>$ locate libmagic.so
/usr/lib/libmagic.so.1
/usr/lib/libmagic.so.1.0.0
$ ls -all /usr/lib/libmagic.so.1*

<p>How do I diagnose this problem further, and what could be wrong? Am I doing something completely stupid?</p>

My question is: (Please refer to the my rephrased question at the bottom)</p>

<p>PS: I am not sure, if this helps:</p>

<p>Disassembly for the first loop basically looks like this (this block is repeated about five times in the full program):</p>

movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [esi+18h]
addsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [eax+38h]
</code></pre>

<p>Each loop of the double loop example produces this code (the following block is repeated about three times):</p>

movsd       mmword ptr [eax+28h],xmm0

</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The question turned out to be of no relevance, as the behavior severely depends on the sizes of the arrays (n) and the CPU cache. So if there is further interest, I rephrase the question:</p>

<p><strong>Could you provide some solid insight into the details that lead to the different cache behaviors as illustrated by the five regions on the following graph?</strong></p>

<p><strong>It might also be interesting to point out the differences between CPU/cache architectures, by providing a similar graph for these CPUs.</strong></p>

All of them seem like they are the same thing - encapsulate the database logic for a specific entity so the calling code has no knowledge of the underlying persistence layer.  From my brief research all of them typically implement your standard CRUD methods and abstract away the database-specific details.</p>

<p>Apart from naming conventions (e.g. CustomerMapper vs. CustomerDAO vs. CustomerGateway vs. CustomerRepository), what is the difference, if any?  If there is a difference, when would you chose one over the other?</p>

<p>In the past I would write code similar to the following (simplified, naturally - I wouldn't normally use public properties):</p>

<pre><code>public class Customer
{
    public long ID;
    public string FirstName;
    public string LastName;
    public string CompanyName;
}

public interface ICustomerGateway
{
    IList&lt;Customer&gt; GetAll();
    Customer GetCustomerByID(long id);
    bool AddNewCustomer(Customer customer);
    bool UpdateCustomer(Customer customer);
    bool DeleteCustomer(long id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and have a <code>CustomerGateway</code> class that implements the specific database logic for all of the methods.  Sometimes I would not use an interface and make all of the methods on the CustomerGateway static (I know, I know, that makes it less testable) so I can call it like:</p>

<pre><code>Customer cust = CustomerGateway.GetCustomerByID(42);
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to be the same principle for the Data Mapper and Repository patterns; the DAO pattern (which is the same thing as Gateway, I think?) also seems to encourage database-specific gateways.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?  It seems a little weird to have 3-4 different ways of doing the same exact thing.</p>

<p>I'm a learning programmer and I've run into a bit of a jumble. I am asked to write a program that will compute and display Fibonacci's Sequence by a user inputted start number and end number (ie. startNumber = 20 endNumber = 100 and it will display only the numbers between that range). The trick is to use it inclusively (which I do not know how to do in Python? - I'm assuming this means to use an inclusive range?).</p>

<p>What I have so far is no actual coding but rather:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write Fib sequence formula to infinite</li>
<li>Display startNumber to endNumber only from Fib sequence.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no idea where to start and I am asking for ideas or insight into how to write this. I also have tried to write the Fib sequence forumla but I get lost on that as well.</p>

<p>Can I do it with bash, and what's the simplest (one line) script to achieve my goal?</p>

I have read many other questions on here about something similar but most involved importing projects from eclipse. I am using what I believe to be the most recent version of android studio and the project was created with android studio and worked without any cannot resolve R problems.

<p>My original answer that was deleted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think I have figured out the issue. The issue is with Android
  Studio, every time I added the admob library all these errors started.
  All my other projects without ads don't have similar issues. I'm now

<p>I have a solution with several projects in it. The current build mode is Debug and all projects' configurations are set to Debug. But when I try to run the main project - sometimes it gives me a few errors, all of which are ""Metadata file '...\Release\projectX.dll' could not be found"" - and, look, it says about RELEASE folder, though current mode is Debug. Why? I tried to search for reference to ""Release\projectX.dll"" inside all solution files, and I found one in ResolveAssemblyReference.cache file.</p>

<p>I made a good search over the Internet and found a few people with a similar problem, but there was no solution, or at least no working solution.</p>

<p>I tried to delete references to those projects and read them, but in some time I start getting these errors again.</p>

<p>It seems like a bug. Why does it search for referenced projects in Release folders when I always use Debug mode?</p>

It's been working great so far except for one thing. In the HTML5 specification, the input type ""number"" can have both integers and floating point numbers. This seems incredibly short-sighted since it will only be a useful validator when your database fields are signed floating point numbers (for unsigned ints you'll have to fall back to ""pattern"" validation and thus loose extra features like the up and down arrows for browsers that support it). Is there another input type or perhaps an attribute that would restrict the input to just unsigned integers? I couldn't find any, thanks.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Ok guys, I appreciate your time and help, but I see many undeserved up-voting going on :D. Setting the step to 1 is not the answer since it doesn't restrict the input. You can still type a negative floating point number into the textbox. Also, I am aware of pattern validation (I mentioned it in my original post), but that was not part of the question. I wanted to know if HTML5 allowed restricting an input of type ""number"" to positive integer values. To this question the answer, it seems, would be ""no, it does not"". I didn't want to use pattern validation because this causes some drawbacks when using jQuery Tools validation, but it now seems that the specification doesn't allow for a cleaner way to do this. </p>

<p>Is there an easier way to break out of nested loops than throwing an exception? (In Perl, you can give labels to each loop and at least continue an outer loop.)  </p>

<pre><code>class BreakIt(Exception): pass

try:

        for y in range(10):
            print x*y

<p>From an implementation perspective, they don't seem that different (but I'm sure they are)... However, my primary language is C#, and of course the 1st method is what I'm used to.</p>

<p>The difficulty seems to be that method 1 is harder to use with the std C++ classes.</p>

<p>Which method should I use?</p>

<h3>Update 1:</h3>

<p>I recently used the <em>new</em> keyword for <em>heap</em> memory (or <em>free store</em>) for a large array which was going out of scope (i.e. being returned from a function). Where before I was using the stack, which caused half of the elements to be corrupt outside of scope, switching to heap usage ensured that the elements were in tact. Yay!</p>

<h3>Update 2:</h3>

<p>A friend of mine recently told me there's a simple rule for using the <code>new</code> keyword; every time you type <code>new</code>, type <code>delete</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Foobar *foobar = new Foobar();
delete foobar; // TODO: Move this to the right place.
</code></pre>

<p>This helps to prevent memory leaks, as you always have to put the delete somewhere (i.e. when you cut and paste it to either a destructor or otherwise).</p>

<p>I understand that Apple (and others who have extended it) provide a <code>Reachability</code> class to assist with determining the network state.

<blockquote>

<p>Having done some research on the issue, I then did the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Saved my servers domain name as a root.cer file.</li>
<li>In my Glassfish server's JRE, I ran this:
keytool -import -alias example -keystore  cacerts -file root.cer.</li>
<li>To check the cert was added to my cacert successfully, I did this:
keytool -list -v -keystore cacerts
I can see the cert is present.</li>
<li>I then restarted Glassfish and retired the 'post'.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am still getting thesame error.</p>

<p>I have a feeling this is because my Glassfish is not actually reading the cacert file that I have amended but maybe some other one.</p>

<p>Have any of you had this issue and can push me in the right direction?</p>

<p><em>Phil Karlton</em></p>

<p>Is there a general solution or method to invalidating a cache; to know when an entry is stale, so you are guaranteed to always get fresh data?</p>

<p>For example, consider a function <code>getData()</code> that gets data from a file.
It caches it based on the last modified time of the file, which it checks every time it's called.<br>
Then you add a second function <code>transformData()</code> which transforms the data, and caches its result for next time the function is called.  It has no knowledge of the file - how do you add the dependency that if the file is changed, this cache becomes invalid?</p>

<p>You could call <code>getData()</code> every time <code>transformData()</code> is called and compare it with the value that was used to build the cache, but that could end up being very costly.</p>

<p>Should I rather create a member function init for the Mutex class and call pthread mutex_init within which would return a bool based on pthread mutex_init's return? This way I don't have to use exceptions for such a low level object.</p>

I'm trying to use the Instagram API to fetch the media.</p>

<p><a href=""http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/</a></p>

<p>The documentation says to GET <code>https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/&lt;user-id&gt;/media/recent/</code>, but it says to pass an OAuth access token. An access token represents the authorization to act on behalf of a user. I don't want users to log into Instagram to see this on the sidebar. They shouldn't even need to have an Instagram account.</p>

<p>For instance, I can go to <a href=""http://instagram.com/thebrainscoop"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://instagram.com/thebrainscoop</a> without being logged into Instagram and see photos. I want to do that through the API.</p>

<p>In the Instagram API, non-user-authenticated requests pass a <code>client_id</code> instead of an <code>access_token</code>. If I try that, though, I get:</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""meta"":{
    ""error_type"":""OAuthParameterException"",
    ""code"":400,
    ""error_message"":""\""access_token\"" URL parameter missing. This OAuth request requires an \""access_token\"" URL parameter.""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, is this not possible? Is there no way to fetch a user's latest (public) media without asking a user to log into an Instagram account through OAuth first?</p>

I have a Visual Studio solution with a C++ DLL referencing the C# DLL. The C# DLL references a few other DLLs, some within my project and some external.

  <p>warning MSB3270: There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being build ""MSIL"" and the processor architecture of the reference ""[internal C# dll]"", ""x86"".</p>

<p>It tells me to go to Configuration Manager to align my architectures. The C# DLL is set up with platform target x86. If I try to change this to something else, like Any CPU, it complains because one of the external DLLs <em>it</em> depends on has platform target x86.</p>

<p>When I look at Configuration Manager it shows the Platform for my C# DLL as x86 and for my C++ project as Win32. This seems like the right setup; surely I don't want the project for my C++ project to have platform set to x64, which is the only other option presented.</p>

As long as the file size of this picture is less then approx. 48KB, all goes well. But if I'm trying to upload a larger picture, the WCF service returns an error: <code>(413) Request Entity Too Large.</code>
So ofcourse I've spent 3 hours Googling the error message and every topic I've seen about this subject suggests raising the 'uploadReadAheadSize' property.

<p><strong>Option 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>logger.debug(""some debug text"");

<p>but some links suggest that it is better to check <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> first, like: </p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong></p>

<pre><code>boolean debugEnabled = logger.isDebugEnabled();
if (debugEnabled) {
    logger.debug(""some debug text"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is ""<strong>Does option 2 improve performance any way?</strong>"".</p>

<p>Because in any case Log4J framework have same check for debugEnabled. For option 2 it might be beneficial if we are using multiple debug statement in single method or class, where the framework does not need to call <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method multiple times (on each call); in this case it calls <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method only once, and if Log4J is configured to debug level then actually it calls <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> method twice:</p>

<ol>
<li>In case of assigning value to debugEnabled variable, and</li>
<li>Actually called by logger.debug() method.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't think that if we write multiple <code>logger.debug()</code> statement in method or class and calling <code>debug()</code> method according to option 1 then it is overhead for Log4J framework in comparison with option 2. Since <code>isDebugEnabled()</code> is a very small method (in terms of code), it might be good candidate for inlining.</p>

<p>I want to add in here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed.

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we use SET NOCOUNT ON for SQL Server? If not, why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What it does</strong> Edit 6, on 22 Jul 2011</p>

<p>It suppresses the ""xx rows affected"" message after any DML. This is a resultset and when sent, the client must process it. It's tiny, but measurable (see answers below)</p>

<p>For triggers etc, the client will receive multiple ""xx rows affected"" and this causes all manner of errors for some ORMs, MS Access, JPA etc (see edits below)</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>General accepted best practice (I thought until this question) is to use <code>SET NOCOUNT ON</code> in triggers and stored procedures in SQL Server. We use it everywhere and a quick google shows plenty of SQL Server MVPs agreeing too.</p>

<p>MSDN says this can break a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">.net SQLDataAdapter</a>.</p>

<p>Now, this means to me that the SQLDataAdapter is limited to utterly simply CRUD processing because it expects the ""n rows affected"" message to match. So, I can't use:</p>

<ul>
<li>IF EXISTS to avoid duplicates (no rows affected message) <em>Note: use with caution</em></li>
<li>WHERE NOT EXISTS (less rows then expected</li>
<li>Filter out trivial updates (eg no data actually changes)</li>
<li>Do any table access before (such as logging)</li>
<li>Hide complexity or denormlisation</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>

<p>In the question marc_s (who knows his SQL stuff) says do not use it. This differs to what I think (and I regard myself as somewhat competent at SQL too).</p>

<p>It's possible I'm missing something (feel free to point out the obvious), but what do you folks out there think?</p>

<p>Note: it's been years since I saw this error because I don't use SQLDataAdapter nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>Edits after comments and questions:</strong></p>

<p>Edit: More thoughts...</p>

<p>We have multiple clients: one may use a C# SQLDataAdaptor, another may use nHibernate from Java. These can be affected in different ways with <code>SET NOCOUNT ON</code>.</p>

<p>If you regard stored procs as methods, then it's bad form (anti-pattern) to assume some internal processing works a certain way for your own purposes.</p>

<p>Edit 2: a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1354362"">trigger breaking nHibernate question</a>, where <code>SET NOCOUNT ON</code> can not be set</p>

<p>But what are the differences?</p>

<hr>

<p>Summary from answers and links below:</p>

<ol>
<li>A pointer can be re-assigned any number of times while a reference cannot be re-seated after binding.</li>
<li>Pointers can point nowhere (<code>NULL</code>), whereas reference always refer to an object.</li>
<li>You can't take the address of a reference like you can with pointers.</li>
<li>There's no ""reference arithmetics"" (but you can take the address of an object pointed by a reference and do pointer arithmetics on it as in <code>&amp;obj + 5</code>).</li>
</ol>

<p>To clarify a misconception:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The C++ standard is very careful to avoid dictating how a compiler must
  implement references, but every C++ compiler implements
  references as pointers. That is, a declaration such as:</em></p>

<pre><code>int &amp;ri = i;
</code></pre>
  
  <p><strong><em>if it's not optimized away entirely</em></strong>, <em>allocates the same amount of storage
  as a pointer, and places the address
  of <code>i</code> into that storage.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>So, a pointer and a reference both occupy the same amount of memory.</em></strong></p>

<p>As a general rule,</p>

<ul>
<li>Use references in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces.</li>
<li>Use pointers to implement algorithms and data structures.</li>
</ul>

How, then, can one explain this</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'

>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>What's the deal?!</p>

<p>I'll explain this a little for those who didn't quite get that.</p>

<pre><code>>>> class MyClass:
...     def myPublicMethod(self):
...             print 'public method'
...     def __myPrivateMethod(self):
...             print 'this is private!!'
... 
>>> obj = MyClass()
</code></pre>

<p>What I did there is create a class with a public method and a private method and instantiate it.</p>

<p>Next, I call its public method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.myPublicMethod()
public method
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I try and call its private method.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj.__myPrivateMethod()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File """", line 1, in 
AttributeError: MyClass instance has no attribute '__myPrivateMethod'
</code></pre>

<p>Everything looks good here; we're unable to call it. It is, in fact, 'private'. Well, actually it isn't. Running <em>dir()</em> on the object reveals a new magical method that python creates magically for all of your 'private' methods.</p>

<pre><code>>>> dir(obj)
['_MyClass__myPrivateMethod', '__doc__', '__module__', 'myPublicMethod']
</code></pre>

<p>This new method's name is always an underscore, followed by the class name, followed by the method name.</p>

<pre><code>>>> obj._MyClass__myPrivateMethod()
this is private!!
</code></pre>

<p>So much for encapsulation, eh?</p>

<p>In any case, I'd always heard Python doesn't support encapsulation, so why even try? What gives?</p>

<p>For example, the following function is <em>O(n)</em> because the algorithm grows in proportion to its input <em>n</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should explicitly set android:allowBackup to true or false (it's true by default, and that can have some security implications for the application's data)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href=""http://tools.android.com/download/adt-21-preview"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>official website</strong></a>, they've written:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A couple of new checks: you must explicitly decide whether your app allows backups, and a label check. There's a new command line flag for setting the library path. Many improvements to the incremental lint analysis while editing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is this warning? What is the backup feature, and how do I use it?</p>

<p>Also, why does the warning tell me it has security implications? What are the disadvantages and advantages of disabling this feature?</p>

<hr>

<p>There are two concepts of backup for the manifest:</p>

<ul>
<li>""android:<strong>allowBackup</strong>"" allows to backup and restore via adb, as shown <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>here</strong></a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether to allow the application to participate in the backup and
  restore infrastructure. If this attribute is set to false, no backup
  or restore of the application will ever be performed, even by a
  full-system backup that would otherwise cause all application data to
  be saved via adb. The default value of this attribute is true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is considered a security issue because people could backup your app via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Debug_Bridge#Android_Debug_Bridge"" rel=""noreferrer"">ADB</a> and then get private data of your app into their PC.</p>

<p>However, I think it's not that of a problem, since most users don't know what adb is, and if they do, they will also know how to root the device. ADB functions would only work if the device has the debugging feature enabled, and this needs the user to enable it.</p>

<p>So, only users that connect their devices to the PC and enable the debugging feature would be affected. If they have a malicious app on their PC that uses the ADB tools, this could be problematic since the app could read the private storage data.</p>

<p>I think Google should just add a feature that is disabled by default, in the developer category, to allow backup&amp;restore of apps via ADB.</p>

<ul>
<li>""android:<strong>backupAgent</strong>"" allows to use the backup and restore feature of the cloud, as shown <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#agent"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>here</strong></a> and <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html#Basics"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>here</strong></a>:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>The name of the class that implement's the application's backup agent,
  a subclass of BackupAgent. The attribute value should be a fully
  qualified class name (such as, ""com.example.project.MyBackupAgent"").
  However, as a shorthand, if the first character of the name is a
  period (for example, "".MyBackupAgent""), it is appended to the package
  name specified in the  element. There is no default. The
  name must be specified.</p>

<p>This isn't a security issue.</p>

<p>EDIT TO ADD:</p>

<p>For production systems, you're probably better off using Nginx or HAProxy to proxy requests to your nodejs app. You can setup nginx to handle the ssl requests and just speak http to your node app.js. </p>

<p>EDIT TO ADD (4/6/2015)</p>

<p>For systems on using AWS, you are better off using EC2 Elastic Load Balancers to handle SSL Termination, and allow regular HTTP traffic to your EC2 web servers. For further security, setup your security group such that only the ELB is allowed to send HTTP traffic to the EC2 instances, which will prevent external unencrypted HTTP traffic from hitting your machines.</p>

I've done a thorough investigation for solutions in regards to this and I know there are topics to this and I've followed them too and nothing has worked. That being said I'll list out exactly everything I've done so far. I am running PHP 5.2.14 with Zend Debugging on the latest Eclipse version on my Windows XP computer. I have a 1 GB of RAM. I have XAMPP running with Apache, MySQL, and FileZilla installed. </p>

<p>On XAMPP I've done the following (Apache was off during these changes):
Clicked on <em>Admin</em> from the XAMPP Control Panel and went to <code>https:// localhost/xampp/</code>. From there I accepted the certs from this line on the welcome page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For OpenSSL support please use the test certificate with https:// 127.0.0.1 or https:// localhost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On that same section I checked <code>phpinfo()</code>. Under 'Environment', <code>SERVER[""HTTPS""]</code> is <code>on</code>. Under 'Apache Environment', <code>HTTPS</code> is <code>On</code>. Under 'PHP Variables, <code>_SERVER[""HTTPS""]</code> is <code>On</code>. Under 'Phar', <code>OpenSSL support</code> is <code>disabled</code> (install ext/openssl). I don't know how to enable the Phar one.</p>

<p>Now regarding the files themselves in C:\xampp, I went to the PHP folder. Under both production and development php.ini files (better safe than sorry), I have <code>allow_url_fopen=On</code>, <code>allow_url_include=On</code>, and I removed the semicolon, so that <code>extension=php_openssl.dll</code> is no longer commented out. I even confirmed that the .dll is in the ext folder of the PHP folder. Both libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll are in the PHP and Apache folders. The Apache folder doesn't contain either productive or development php.ini files.</p>

<p>I've went to <a href=""http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html"">http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html</a> and installed Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.0d for safe measure.</p>

<p>Now the line of code in question in my retrieve_website.php looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$urlquery = ""https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key="".$appid.""&amp;cx="".$google_searchid.""&amp;q="".$query.""&amp;alt=atom&amp;num="".$results;
$xmlresults = file_get_contents($urlquery);
</code></pre>

<p>I have two other websites that I query but they are served via HTTP and they work fine. I also have this line of code entered near the end of the script:</p>

<pre><code>echo 'openssl: ',  extension_loaded  ('openssl') ? 'yes':'no', ""\n"";
echo 'http wrapper: ', in_array('http', $w) ? 'yes':'no', ""\n"";
echo 'https wrapper: ', in_array('https', $w) ? 'yes':'no', ""\n"";
echo 'wrappers: ', var_dump($w);
</code></pre>

<p>When I run it as a PHP Script on Eclipse, everything outputs perfectly fine the way I want along with these results:</p>

<pre><code>openssl: yes
http wrapper: yes
https wrapper: yes
wrappers: array(10) {
  [0]=&gt;
  string(5) ""https""
  [1]=&gt;
  string(4) ""ftps""
  [2]=&gt;
  string(3) ""php""
  [3]=&gt;
  string(4) ""file""
  [4]=&gt;
  string(4) ""data""
  [5]=&gt;
  string(4) ""http""
  [6]=&gt;
  string(3) ""ftp""
  [7]=&gt;
  string(13) ""compress.zlib""
  [8]=&gt;
  string(14) ""compress.bzip2""
  [9]=&gt;
  string(3) ""zip""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Despite all these changes I've made (after I started up Apache), I still get the same errors the first time I access my PHP script in Eclipse and Firefox via <a href=""http://localhost/tutorial/retrieve_website.php"">http://localhost/tutorial/retrieve_website.php</a>:</p>

<p>What is it that I have overlooked or failed to do? To my own knowledge, I've done everything that I've researched about concerning HTTPS and OpenSSL</p>

<p>I can also create an <code>EDMX</code> diagram and choose a code generation step that uses T4 templates to generate the same <code>POCO</code> classes. </p>

<p>In both cases I end up with <code>POCO</code> object which are <code>ORM</code> agnostic and context that derives from <code>DbContext</code>.</p>

<p>Database-first seems to be most appealing since I can design database in Enterprise Manager, quickly synch the model and fine-tune it using the designer. </p>

<p>So what is the difference between those two approaches? Is it just about the preference VS2010 vs Enterprise Manager?</p>

<p>After using this syntax liberally in my js files, I ran one of the files through <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">jsLint</a>, and it freaked out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: Problem at line 1 character 22: Expected ')' and instead saw '4'.<br>

<p>After reading through <a href=""http://www.jslint.com/lint.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">jsLint's explanation of its behavior</a>, it looks like jsLint doesn't really like the <code>new Array()</code> syntax, and instead prefers <code>[]</code> when declaring arrays.</p>

<p>So I have a couple questions.  First, why?  Am I running any risk by using the <code>new Array()</code> syntax instead?  Are there browser incompatibilities that I should be aware of?  And second, if I switch to the square bracket syntax, is there any way to declare an array and set its length all on one line, or do I have to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var test = [];
test.length = 4;

<p>To avoid this, I can easily attach a click event handler on the dropdown menu and simply add the famous <code>event.stopPropagation()</code>. </p>

              &lt;img alt="""" class=""img-rounded"" src=""img1.jpg""&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class=""item active""&gt;
              &lt;img alt="""" class=""img-rounded"" src=""img2.jpg""&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This looks easy and a very common behavior, however, and since <code>carousel-controls</code> (as well as <code>carousel indicators</code>) event handlers are delegated to the <code>document</code> object, the <code>click</code> event on these elements (<strong>prev/next</strong> controls, ...) will be “ignored”.</p>

<pre><code>$('ul.dropdown-menu.mega-dropdown-menu').on('click', function(event){
    // The event won't be propagated up to the document NODE and 
    // therefore delegated events won't be fired
    event.stopPropagation();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Relying on Twitter Bootstrap dropdown <code>hide</code>/<code>hidden</code> events is not a solution for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The provided event for both event handlers doesn’t give you reference to the clicked element</li>
<li>The dropdown menu content is dynamically generated so adding a <code>flag</code> class is not possible</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/zend_php_dev/80oLdtbf/1/"" rel=""noreferrer"">This fiddle</a> is the normal behavior and <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/zend_php_dev/80oLdtbf/2/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this fiddle</a> is with <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> added.</p>

I'm not well versed in theory, but think I know enough.</p>

<p>I argued that there could not exist a deterministic Turing machine that always won or stalemated at chess.  I think that, even if you search the entire space of all combinations of player1/2 moves, the single move that the computer decides upon at each step is based on a heuristic.  Being based on a heuristic, it does not necessarily beat ALL of the moves that the opponent could do.</p>

<p>My friend thought, to the contrary, that a computer would always win or tie if it never made a ""mistake"" move (however do you define that?).  However, being a programmer who has taken CS, I know that even your good choices - given a wise opponent - can force you to make ""mistake"" moves in the end.  Even if you know everything, your next move is greedy in matching a heuristic.</p>

<p>Most chess computers try to match a possible end game to the game in progress, which is essentially a dynamic programming traceback.  Again, the endgame in question is avoidable though.</p>

<p>Edit: Hmm... looks like I ruffled some feathers here.  That's good.</p>

<p>Thinking about it again, it seems like there is no theoretical problem with solving a finite game like chess.  I would argue that chess is a bit more complicated than checkers in that a win is not necessarily by numerical exhaustion of pieces, but by a mate.  My original assertion is probably wrong, but then again I think I've pointed out something that is not yet satisfactorily proven (formally).</p>

<p>I guess my thought experiment was that whenever a branch in the tree is taken, then the algorithm (or memorized paths) must find a path to a mate (without getting mated) for any possible branch on the opponent moves. After the discussion, I will buy that given more memory than we can possibly dream of, all these paths could be found.</p>

I said it was probably more efficient to use a range or digit specifier than a character set.</p>

<p>I decided to test that out today and found out to my surprise that (in the C# regex engine at least) <code>\d</code> appears to be less efficient than either of the other two which don't seem to differ much. Here is my test output over 10000 random strings of 1000 random characters with 5077 actually containing a digit:</p>

<pre><code>Regular expression \d           took 00:00:00.2141226 result: 5077/10000
Regular expression [0-9]        took 00:00:00.1357972 result: 5077/10000  63.42 % of first
Regular expression [0123456789] took 00:00:00.1388997 result: 5077/10000  64.87 % of first
</code></pre>

<p>It's a surprise to me for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I would have thought the range would be implemented much more efficiently than the set.</li>
<li>I can't understand why <code>\d</code> is worse than <code>[0-9]</code>. Is there more to <code>\d</code> than simply shorthand for <code>[0-9]</code>?</li>
</ol>

Part of the task is to extract an image file from the <code>canvas</code> object and append it to a <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/XMLHttpRequest-2/#the-formdata-interface"" rel=""noreferrer"">FormData</a> object for upload.</p>

<p>The issue is that while <code>canvas</code> has the <code>toDataURL</code> function to return a representation of the image file, the FormData object only accepts File or Blob objects from the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/"" rel=""noreferrer"">File API</a>.</p>

<p>The Mozilla solution used the following Firefox-only function on <code>canvas</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is more complex, while the accepted answer does the same thing in a simpler way.</li>
<li>The usability of accepted answer is better. When you click in the middle of the text, text gets unselected when you release the mouse allowing you to start editing instantly, and if you still want to select all, just press the button again and this time it will not unselect on release. Following Donelle's recipe, if I click in the middle of text, I have to click second time to be able to edit. If I click somewhere within the text versus outside of the text, this most probably means I want to start editing instead of overwriting everything.</li>

<p>Thanks for your answers!</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDIT: Let me summarize the responses I got</h2>

<p>So, this is basically a ""padding oracle"" type of attack. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3720720/how-serious-is-this-new-asp-net-security-vulnerability-and-how-can-i-workaround-i/3721473#3721473"">@Sri</a> provided a great explanation about what does this type of attack mean. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yghiC_U2RaM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a shocking video about the issue!</a></p>

<p>About the seriousness of this vulnerability: Yes, it is indeed serious. <em>It lets the attacker to get to know the machine key of an application.</em> Thus, he can do some <strong>very</strong> unwanted things.</p>

<ul>
<li>In posession of the app's machine key, the attacker can decrypt authentication cookies.</li>
<li>Even worse than that, he can <strong>generate authentication cookies</strong> with the name of any user. Thus, he can appear as anyone on the site. The application is unable to differentiate between you or the hacker who generated an authentication cookie with your name for himself.</li>
<li>It also lets him to decrypt (and also generate) <strong>session cookies</strong>, although this is not as dangerous as the previous one.</li>
<li>Not so serious: He can decrypt the encrypted ViewState of pages. (If you use ViewState to store confidental data, you shouldn't do this anyways!)</li>
<li><strong>Quite unexpected</strong>: With the knowledge of the machine key, the attacker <strong>can download</strong> any arbitrary file from your web application, even those that normally can't be downloaded! (Including <strong>Web.Config</strong>, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a bunch of good practices I got that <strong>don't</strong> solve the issue but help improve the general security of a web application.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zhhddkxy%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">You can encrypt sensitive data with Protected Configuration</a></li>

<li>Prevent DoS attacks</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let's focus on this issue.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>The solution</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable customErrors and make a single error page to which <strong>all errors</strong> are redirected. Yes, <strong>even 404s</strong>. (ScottGu said that differentiating between 404s and 500s are essential for this attack.) Also, into your <code>Application_Error</code> or <code>Error.aspx</code> put some code that makes a random delay. (Generate a random number, and use Thread.Sleep to sleep for that long.) This will make it impossible for the attacker to decide what exactly happened on your server.</li>
<li>Some people recommended switching back to 3DES. In theory, if you don't use AES, you don't encounter the security weakness in the AES implementation. As it turns out, this is <strong>not recommended at all</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other thoughts</p>

<ul>
<li>Seems that <a href=""http://www.onpreinit.com/2010/09/aspnet-vulnerability-workaround-flawed.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">not</a> <a href=""http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/linqed/archive/2010/09/19/padding-oracle-asp-net-vulnerability-explanation.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">everyone</a> thinks the workaround is good enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not very long ago, a discussion began inside a certain <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/49271187/4909087"">question</a> regarding whether the strings passed to print statements could be modified after/during the call to <code>print</code> has been made. For example, consider the function:</p>

<pre><code>def print_something():
    print('This cat was scared.')
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when <code>print</code> is run, then the output to the terminal should display </p>

<pre><code>This dog was scared.
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the word ""cat"" has been replaced by the word ""dog"". Something somewhere somehow was able to modify those internal buffers to change what was printed. Assume this is done without the original code author's explicit permission (hence, hacking/hijacking).</p>

<p>This <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49271187/how-to-change-a-string-in-a-function-when-calling-a-function/49271219?noredirect=1#comment85545706_49271219"">comment</a> from the wise @abarnert, in particular, got me thinking:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are a couple of ways to do that, but they're all very ugly, and
  should never be done. The least ugly way is to probably replace the
  <code>code</code> object inside the function with one with a different <code>co_consts</code>
  list. Next is probably reaching into the C API to access the str's
  internal buffer. [...] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it looks like this is actually possible. </p>

<p>Here's my naive way of approaching this problem:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import inspect
&gt;&gt;&gt; exec(inspect.getsource(print_something).replace('cat', 'dog'))    
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_something()
This dog was scared.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, <code>exec</code> is bad, but that doesn't really answer the question, because it does not actually modify anything <em>during when/after</em> <code>print</code> is called.</p>

<p>How would it be done as @abarnert has explained it? </p>

<h2>Update - Extend</h2>

<p>Here is an example of a simple test project that is not working on <a href=""https://github.com/raykrow/xunit-vs2017/tree/master"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitHub</a>. This is an example with xUnit but I have tried NUnit and visual studio built in MS tests. No matter what testing or what changes I make I cannot get the VS test runner to find any tests. </p>

<h3>What I've Tried</h3>

<ul>
<li>Deleting VS test cache files <code>DEL %TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code></li>
<li>Restarting VS</li>
<li>Closing/Opening test explorer</li>
<li>for xUnit installed <code>Microsoft.DotNet.InternalAbstractions</code> (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35103781/why-is-the-visual-studio-2015-2017-test-runner-not-discovering-my-xunit-v2-tests"">see SO post</a>)</li>
<li>for NUnit ensure adapter installed and same version (3) as NUnit package</li>
<li><code>test -&gt; test settings -&gt; default processor architecture</code> is set to x86</li>

The view contains a single UILabel with the app version, and 2 UIImageViews with images that are both present in Images.xcassets: A logo and a splash image.</p>

<p>The UILabel and the logo image appear correctly when I launch the application, but the splash image does not if I run the app on an iPad Air 2 with iOS9. I have tested on an Air and a Mini running iOS8, and iOS9 simulators for iPad 2, iPad Air, and iPad Air 2 and the image appears correctly in all of those.</p>

<p>I ran some basic troubleshooting to see if I could figure out what is going on but I haven't been able to solve it and the only difference I can see between the image that's working and the one that's failing is <em>when</em> I added it to the assets...</p>

<p>Here's a rundown of what I know:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The UIImageView for the splash image is in the correct place, at the correct size. I can tell this because I set its background color to green just to make sure. The view is there, but the image does not appear. So I'm assuming that the view is not to blame.</p></li>
<li><p>Setting the UIImageView for the splash image to also use the logo image makes the logo image appear in the correct place for the view. This also leads me to assume that the view is not to blame.</p></li>
<li><p>The UIImage that I am using in the splash image view is used elsewhere in the app and appears fine in those other views (the logo image is also used elsewhere in the app and appears fine). So I'm assuming that the image is valid and having it appear in other views is not a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>I've confirmed that the settings of the UIImages for the logo and splash in the xcassets file are the same. They are set to Universal, Any width and height, multiple scale factors, rendered as default. There is one difference - the logo has 1x, 2x and 3x scales while the splash image only has 1x and 2x, but I have also tried using UIImages with only 1x, and 1x and 2x values in the UIView and they work (if they were added to the project some time ago).</p></li>
<li><p>Adding another image of a different size or format (PNG and JPG) to my xcassets and using that UIImage in the UIImageView for the splash image also fails to display.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding another UIImageView to the XIB file and allocating it a UIImage that was already in the xcassets works, the image appears in the loading screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Copying and renaming the image files used for the logo and adding them to the project then using that UIImage in the splash view also fails to display.</p></li>
<li><p>I have tried cleaning the project, restarting the development machine, and deleting the app from the Air 2 and reinstalling it just in case that was a problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These last three steps lead me to believe that there's some issue with images added after a certain point in the project file's lifetime. While I updated to Xcode 7 yesterday, the splash image was originally added in Xcode 6, but the logo image (also added in Xcode 6) was added some months before.</p>

<p>I've looked over the json files for the logo image and splash image and they appear to have the same format. I've also trawled through the pbxproj file looking for differences and I can't see any.</p>

<p>So I was wondering if anyone had any idea why the launch screen might not display these new images I'm adding on the Air 2 specifically? Other questions I've been reading through relating to images not appearing all seem to relate either to Launch Images, or to images in XIB files that have associated classes, neither of which seems relevant here.</p>

More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a ""bundle""
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.

<ul>

<li>Data node machine spec:

<ul>
<li>CPU: Core i7-4790 (# of cores: 4, # of threads: 8)</li>

<li><p>Input data</p>

<ul>

<li>Size: 165GB</li>
<li>Number of lines: 454,568,833</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Output</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of lines after second filter: 310,640,717</li>
<li>Number of lines of the result file: 99,848,268</li>
<li>Size of the result file: 41GB</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The job was run with following configurations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>--master yarn-client --executor-memory 19G --executor-cores 7 --num-executors 3</code> (executors per data node, use as much as cores)</p></li>
<li><p><code>--master yarn-client --executor-memory 19G --executor-cores 4 --num-executors 3</code> (# of cores reduced)</p></li>
<li><p><code>--master yarn-client --executor-memory 4G --executor-cores 2 --num-executors 12</code> (less core, more executor)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Elapsed times:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>50 min 15 sec</p></li>
<li><p>55 min 48 sec</p></li>
<li><p>31 min 23 sec</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To my surprise, (3) was much faster.<br>
I thought that (1) would be faster, since there would be less inter-executor communication when shuffling.<br>
Although # of cores of (1) is fewer than (3), #of cores is not the key factor since 2) did perform well.</p>

<p>(Followings were added after pwilmot's answer.)</p>

<p>For the information, the performance monitor screen capture is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ganglia data node summary for (1) - job started at 04:37.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/bVnyJ.png"" alt=""Ganglia data node summary for (1)""></p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2K2Kp.png"" alt=""Ganglia data node summary for (3)""></p>

<p>The graph roughly divides into 2 sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>First: from start to reduceByKey: CPU intensive, no network activity</li>
<li>Second: after reduceByKey: CPU lowers, network I/O is done.</li>
</ul>

<p>As the graph shows, (1) can use as much CPU power as it was given. So, it might not be the problem of the number of the threads.</p>

<p>How to explain this result?</p>

I need to display the amount of coffee in grams. The ""g"" symbol for grams needs to be attached to my UILabel that I am using to display the amount. The numbers in the UILabel are changing dynamically with user input just fine, but I need to add a lower case ""g"" on the end of the string that is formatted differently from the  updating numbers. The ""g"" needs to be attached to the numbers so that as the number size and position changes, the ""g"" ""moves"" with the numbers. I'm sure this problem has been solved before so a link in the right direction would be helpful as I've googled my little heart out.</p>

<p>I've searched through the documentation for an attributed string and I even downloded an ""Attributed String Creator"" from the app store, but the resulting code is in Objective-C and I am using Swift. What would be awesome, and probably helpful to other developers learning this language, is a clear example of creating a custom font with custom attributes using an attributed string in Swift. The documentation for this is very confusing as there is not a very clear path on how to do so. My plan is to create the attributed string and add it to the end of my coffeeAmount string.</p>

<pre><code>var coffeeAmount: String = calculatedCoffee + attributedText

<p>Where calculatedCoffee is an Int converted to a string and ""attributedText"" is the lowercase ""g"" with customized font that I am trying to create. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Update Nov 2015</strong>:</p>

<p>A shell script or waiting inside your program is maybe a possible solution. But after seeing this <a href=""https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/374"" rel=""noreferrer"">Issue</a> I am looking for a command or feature of docker/docker-compose itself.</p>

<p>They mention a  solution for implementing a health check, which may be the best option. A open tcp connection does not mean your service is ready or may remain ready. In addition to that I need to change my entrypoint in my dockerfile.</p>

<p>So I am hoping for an answer with docker-compose on board commands, which will hopefully the case if they finish this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Update March 2016</strong></p>

<p>There is a <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21142"" rel=""noreferrer"">proposal</a> for providing a built-in way to determine if a container is ""alive"". So docker-compose can maybe make use of it in near future.</p>

<p><strong>Update June 2016</strong></p>

<p>It seems that the healthcheck will be <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/23218"" rel=""noreferrer"">integrated</a> into docker in Version 1.12.0</p>

<p><strong>Update Januar 2017</strong></p>

<p>I found a docker-compose solution see:

<p>I'm at my wit's end, what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> If I change the port of the project (e.g. to 55555) it starts... This is not a desirable solution since these projects are worked on by several people. Maybe the port is blocked by something else? If so, is there an easy way to check by what?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Port 62940 seems to be free. Running <code>netstat</code> does not show any application listening to it. Something else must be wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> I tried starting the project today after not touching it for a few months. It worked but I don't know why.</p>

I read what <a href=""http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#init"">Effective Go</a> says but I was unsure if I understood fully what it said. The exact sentence I am unsure is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And finally means finally: init is called after all the variable declarations in the package have evaluated their initializers, and those are evaluated only after all the imported packages have been initialized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does <code>all the variable declarations in the package have evaluated their initializers</code> mean? Does it mean if you declare ""global"" variables in a package and its files, init() will not run until all of it is evaluated and then it will run all the init function and then main() when ./main_file_name is ran?</p>

<p>I also read Mark Summerfield's go book the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a package has one or more init() functions they are automatically executed before the main package's main() function is called.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my understanding, <code>init()</code> is only relevant when you run intend to run main() right? or the Main package. Anyone understands more precisely <code>init()</code> feel free to correct me</p>

<p>When I use Fiddler to view the HTTP requests being sent back and forth I've noticed that the 'fake browser\'s' requests often have 'no-cache' in the response header.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>They're attached to buttons for placing a bet, and it works fine for placing a bet on the first hand during a game (firing only once); but in betting for the second hand, it fires the click event twice each time a bet or place bet button is pressed (so twice the correct amount is bet for each press).  Overall, it follows this pattern for number of times the click event is fired when pressing a bet button once--where the <em>ith</em> term of the sequence is for the betting of the <em>ith</em> hand from the beginning of the game: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, which appears to be n(n+1)/2 + 1 for whatever that's worth--and I wasn't smart enough to figure that out, I used <a href=""http://oeis.org/"">OEIS</a>. :)</p>

        }

<p>Which is amazingly cool and was know to be a <a href=""https://github.com/JakeWharton/sdk-manager-plugin"" rel=""noreferrer"">JakeWharton project</a>.</p>

<p>But, to download the SDK library you need to: accept the license agreements or gradle tells you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have not accepted the license agreements of the following SDK
  components: [Android SDK Build-Tools 24, Android SDK Platform 24].
  Before building your project, you need to accept the license
  agreements and complete the installation of the missing components
  using the Android Studio SDK Manager. Alternatively, to learn how to
  transfer the license agreements from one workstation to another, go to
  <a href=""http://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/export-licenses.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://d.android.com/r/studio-ui/export-licenses.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is a problem because I would love to install all sdk dependencies while doing a <code>gradle build</code>.</p>

<p>I am looking for a solution to automatically accept all licenses. Maybe a gradle script ?
Do you have any ideas ?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>[EDIT]</p>

<p>A solution was to execute:</p>

<pre><code>android update sdk --no-ui --filter build-tools-24.0.0,android-24,extra-android-m2repository
</code></pre>

<p>And install it manually, but it is the gradle's new feature purpose to do it.</p>

<p>[EDIT 2]</p>

<p>A better solution is to use the sdkmananger:</p>

<pre><code>yes | sudo sdkmanager --licenses

<li>Yes, I know that programming pros prefer sniffing out feature-support instead of browser-type but I don't feel this approach makes sense in this case. I already know that all (relevant) non-IE browsers support the features that I need and that all <code>pre-v9 IE</code> browsers don't. Checking feature by feature throughout the site would be a waste.</li>
<li>Yes, I know that someone trying to access the site using <code>IE v1</code> (or >= 20) wouldn't get 'badBrowser' set to true and the warning page wouldn't be displayed properly. That's a risk we're willing to take.</li>
<li>Yes, I know that Microsoft has ""conditional comments"" that can be used for precise browser version detection. IE no longer supports conditional comments as of <code>IE 10</code>, rendering this approach absolutely useless.</li>

Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>
<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds flattened dependencies trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which do it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter on front-end).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li>
<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li>
<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").</li>
<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=""https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> &amp; <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li>
<li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?</em> </li>
<li><em>When would you use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins?</em></li>

<pre><code>data ShowBox = forall s. Show s =&gt; SB s
</code></pre>

<p>This is only a subset, however, of how <code>forall</code> is used and I simply cannot wrap my mind around its use in things like this:</p>

<pre><code>runST :: forall a. (forall s. ST s a) -&gt; a
</code></pre>

<p>Or explaining why these are different:</p>

<pre><code>foo :: (forall a. a -&gt; a) -&gt; (Char,Bool)
bar :: forall a. ((a -&gt; a) -&gt; (Char, Bool))
</code></pre>

<p>Or the whole <code>RankNTypes</code> stuff...</p>

<p>I tend to prefer clear, jargon-free English rather than the kinds of language which are normal in academic environments.  Most of the explanations I attempt to read on this (the ones I can find through search engines) have these problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>They're incomplete.  They explain one part of the use of this keyword (like ""existential types"") which makes me feel happy until I read code that uses it in a completely different way (like <code>runST</code>, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> above).</li>
<li>They're densely packed with assumptions that I've read the latest in whatever branch of discrete math, category theory or abstract algebra is popular this week.  (If I never read the words ""consult the paper <em>whatever</em> for details of implementation"" again, it will be too soon.)</li>
<li>They're written in ways that frequently turn even simple concepts into tortuously twisted and fractured grammar and semantics.</li>
</ol>

<p>So...</p>

<p>On to the actual question.  Can anybody completely explain the <code>forall</code> keyword in clear, plain English (or, if it exists somewhere, point to such a clear explanation which I've missed) that doesn't assume I'm a mathematician steeped in the jargon?</p>

<p>There were two stand-out answers from the higher-quality ones below, but unfortunately I can only choose one as best.  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do/3071365#3071365"">Norman's answer</a> was detailed and useful, explaining things in a way that showed some of the theoretical underpinnings of <code>forall</code> and at the same time showing me some of the practical implications of it.  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071136/what-does-the-forall-keyword-in-haskell-ghc-do/3071932#3071932"">yairchu's answer</a> covered an area nobody else mentioned (scoped type variables) and illustrated all of the concepts with code and a GHCi session.  Were it possible to select both as best, I would.  Unfortunately I can't and, after looking over both answers closely, I've decided that yairchu's slightly edges out Norman's because of the illustrative code and attached explanation.  This is a bit unfair, however, because really I needed both answers to understand this to the point that <code>forall</code> doesn't leave me with a faint sense of dread when I see it in a type signature.</p>

<p>The app I'm working on isn't really a location app per se, but it does need to get the user's location in order to display a list of nearby businesses.  It doesn't need to worry about if the user is moving around or anything like that.</p>

<p>Here's what I'd like to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Show the user a list of nearby locations.</li>
<li>Preload the user's location so that by the time I need it in <code>Activity</code> X, it will be available.</li>
<li>I don't particularly care about accuracy or frequency of update. Just grabbing one location is sufficient as long as it's not way off. Maybe if I want to be fancy I'll update the location once every few mins or so, but it's not a huge priority.</li>
<li>Work for any device as long as it has either a GPS or a Network Location provider.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems like it shouldn't be that hard, but it appears to me that I have to spin up two different location providers (GPS and NETWORK) and manage each's lifecycle. Not only that, but I have to duplicate the same code in multiple activities to satisfy #2. I've tried using <code>getBestProvider()</code> in the past to cut the solution down to just using one location provider, but that seems to only give you the best ""theoretical"" provider rather than the provider that's actually going to give you the best results.</p>

<p>I have read the other stackoverflow threads regarding <strong>Abstract Factory vs Factory Method</strong>. I understand the intent of each pattern. However, I am not clear on the definition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Factory Method defines an interface
  for creating an object, but lets
  subclasses decide which of those to
  instantiate. A factory method lets
  classes defer instantiation to
  subclasses.</p>
  
  <p>By contrast, an Abstract Factory
  provides an interface for creating
  families of related or dependent
  objects without specifying their
  concrete classes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1001767/design-patterns-factory-vs-abstract-factory"">John Feminella</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> looks very similar to the <strong>Factory Method</strong>. I have drawn a few UML classes to illustrate my point. </p>

<p>Note: </p>

<ul>
<li>The diagram are from <em>www.yuml.com</em> so they are not perfectly oriented. But its a free service :).</li>
<li>The diagrams may not be perfect. I am still learning the <strong>GoF</strong> design patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Factory Method:</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/69jJo.jpg"" alt=""Factory Method""></p>

<p><strong>Abstract Factory (more members):</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yMP7a.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>If the <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> has only one creator and one product, is it still the <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> pattern? <em>(an interface for creating familes)</em></li>
<li>Can the <strong>Factory Method</strong> concrete creator be created from an Interface or does it have to be from a class? <em>(classes defer instantiations to subclasses)</em></li>
<li>If the Abstract Factory can have only one creator and one product, is the only difference between the <strong>Abstract Factory</strong> and the <strong>Factory Method</strong> that the creator for the former is an Interface and the creator for the latter is a Class?</li>

I use Python for my data analysis and now I'm stuck trying to divide the paws into (anatomical) subregions.</p>

<p>I made a 2D array of each paw, that consists of the maximal values for each sensor that has been loaded by the paw over time. Here's an example of one paw, where I used Excel to draw the areas I want to 'detect'. These are 2 by 2 boxes around the sensor with local maxima's, that together have the largest sum.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/BuUbq.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So I tried some experimenting and decide to simply look for the maximums of each column and row (can't look in one direction due to the shape of the paw). This seems to 'detect' the location of the separate toes fairly well, but it also marks neighboring sensors. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UyNRU.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So what would be the best way to tell Python which of these maximums are the ones I want? </p>

<p><strong>Note: The 2x2 squares can't overlap, since they have to be separate toes!</strong></p>

<p>Also I took 2x2 as a convenience, any more advanced solution is welcome, but I'm simply a human movement scientist, so I'm neither a real programmer or a mathematician, so please keep it 'simple'. </p>

<p>Here's a <a href=""https://upl.io/0liy07"" rel=""noreferrer"">version that can be loaded with <code>np.loadtxt</code></a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>So I tried @jextee's solution (see the results below). As you can see, it works very on the front paws, but it works less well for the hind legs. </p>

<p>More specifically, it can't recognize the small peak that's the fourth toe. This is obviously inherent to the fact that the loop looks top down towards the lowest value, without taking into account where this is. </p>

<p>Would anyone know how to tweak @jextee's algorithm, so that it might be able to find the 4th toe too?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFX0x.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Since I haven't processed any other trials yet, I can't supply any other samples. But the data I gave before were the averages of each paw. This file is an array with the maximal data of 9 paws in the order they made contact with the plate.</p>

<p>This image shows how they were spatially spread out over the plate.</p>

<hr>

<h2>New update:</h2>

<p>So after the help I got with my questions regarding <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/4087919/77595"">paw detection</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/4502656/77595"">paw sorting</a>, I was finally able to check the toe detection for every paw! Turns out, it doesn't work so well in anything but paws sized like the one in my own example. Off course in hindsight, it's my own fault for choosing the 2x2 so arbitrarily.</p>

<p>Here's a nice example of where it goes wrong: a nail is being recognized as a toe and the 'heel' is so wide, it gets recognized twice!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JEpIa.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The paw is too large, so taking a 2x2 size with no overlap, causes some toes to be detected twice. The other way around, in small dogs it often fails to find a 5th toe, which I suspect is being caused by the 2x2 area being too large.</p>

<p>After <a href=""http://www.flipserd.com/blog/ivoflipse/post/toe-detection-revisited"" rel=""noreferrer"">trying the current solution on all my measurements</a> I came to the staggering conclusion that for nearly all my small dogs it didn't find a 5th toe and that in over 50% of the impacts for the large dogs it would find more!</p>

<p>So clearly I need to change it. My own guess was changing the size of the <code>neighborhood</code> to something smaller for small dogs and larger for large dogs. But <code>generate_binary_structure</code> wouldn't let me change the size of the array. </p>

<p>Therefore, I'm hoping that anyone else has a better suggestion for locating the toes, perhaps having the toe area scale with the paw size?</p>

<p><strong>So what is the iBeacon Bluetooth Profile?</strong></p>

<p>Bluetooth Low Energy uses GATT for LE profile service discovery. So I think we need to know the Attribute Handle, Attribute Type, Attribute Value, and maybe the Attribute Permissions of the iBeacon attribute. So for an iBeacon with a UUID of E2C56DB5-DFFB-48D2-B060-D0F5A71096E0 a major value of 1 and a minor value of 1 what would the Bluetooth GATT profile service be?</p>

<p>Heres some assumptions I've made from the discussion on Apple's forums and through the docs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You only need to see the profile service (GATT) of a Bluetooth peripheral to know it is an iBeacon.</p></li>
<li><p>The Major and Minor keys are encoded somewhere in this profile service</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Heres some companies with iBeacon Dev Kits that seem to have this figure out already:</p>

Same goes for the book I am following (Beazley's Python Reference), which says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The m.copy() method makes a shallow
  copy of the items contained in a
  mapping object and places them in a
  new mapping object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; original = dict(a=1, b=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; new = original.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; new.update({'c': 3})
&gt;&gt;&gt; original
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; new
{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}
</code></pre>

<p>So I assumed this would update the value of <code>original</code> (and add 'c': 3) also since I was doing a shallow copy. Like if you do it for a list:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; original = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new = original
&gt;&gt;&gt; new.append(4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; new, original
([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])
</code></pre>

<p>This works as expected.</p>

<p>Since both are shallow copies, why is that the <code>dict.copy()</code> doesn't work as I expect it to? Or my understanding of shallow vs deep copying is flawed?</p>

        }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then using the suggestions below I changed the above code to make it work with get and set methods. I just need to add ""?"" in EnumTest class during declaration of private enum variable and in get/set method:</p>

<pre><code>public class EnumTest
{
    private string name;
    private ValidColors? myColor; //added ""?"" here in declaration and in get/set method

    public string Name
    {
        get { return name; }
        set { name = value; }
    }

    public ValidColors? MyColor
    {
        get { return myColor; }
        set { myColor = value; }
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks all for the lovely suggestions.</p>

<p>I'm trying to now reorganize things, creating real folders and importing them into Xcode. Unfortunately Xcode doesn't let me work with them the way it does with groups.

<p>So, I want to look at all of the classes in my application's universe, and when I find one that descends from Animal, I want to create a new object of that type and add it to the list.  This allows me to add functionality without having to update a list of things.  I can avoid the following:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Animal&gt; animals = new ArrayList&lt;Animal&gt;();
animals.add( new Dog() );
animals.add( new Cat() );
animals.add( new Donkey() );
...

<p>With the above approach, I can simply create a new class that extends Animal and it'll get picked up automatically.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 10/16/2008 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time:</p>

<p>This question has generated a lot of great responses -- thank you.  From the responses and my research, I've found that what I really want to do is just not possible under Java.  There are approaches, such as ddimitrov's ServiceLoader mechanism that can work -- but they are very heavy for what I want, and I believe I simply move the problem from Java code to an external configuration file.  </p>

<p>Another way to state what I want: a static function in my Animal class finds and instantiates all classes that inherit from Animal -- without any further configuration/coding.  If I have to configure, I might as well just instantiate them in the Animal class anyway.  I understand that because a Java program is just a loose federation of .class files that that's just the way it is.</p>

<p>Interestingly, it seems this is <a href=""http://my.safaribooksonline.com/0596003390/csharpckbk-CHP-12-SECT-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">fairly trivial</a> in C#.</p>

<p>My setup is that I have a web.config in my root directory, and then I'm trying to make a company portal, in the /portal/directory.  The /portal/ directory has its own (necessary) web.config.  </p>

<p>My web.config line 50 is like this:</p>

</ul>

<p>But if I use 2*pi, it doesn't move at all (since it's the same position). If I try to do just pi (180 degrees), it works, but if I call the method again, it rotates backwards.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>[UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                      delay:0.0
                    options:0

                     [UIView setAnimationRepeatCount:HUGE_VALF];
                     [UIView setAnimationBeginsFromCurrentState:YES];
                     imageToMove.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI);

<p>doesn't work either. It goes to <code>180</code> degrees, pauses for a split second, then resets back to <code>0</code> degrees before it starts again.</p>

I've done it the easy way, by using the built-in Math.sqrt() function, but I'm wondering if there is a way to do it faster by restricting yourself to integer-only domain.  Maintaining a lookup table is impratical (since there are about 2<sup>31.5</sup> integers whose square is less than 2<sup>63</sup>).</p>

<p>Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now:</p>

<pre><code>public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  if (n &lt; 0)
    return false;

  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);
  return tst*tst == n;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><i>Notes: I'm using this function in many <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Project Euler</a> problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.</i></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>:  A new solution posted by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/3508/a-rex"">A. Rex</a> has proven to be even faster.  In a run over the first 1 billion integers, the solution only required 34% of the time that the original solution used.  While the John Carmack hack is a little better for small values of <em>n</em>, the benefit compared to this solution is pretty small.</p>

<p>Here is the A. Rex solution, converted to Java:</p>

<pre><code>private final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n)
{
  // Quickfail
  if( n &lt; 0 || ((n&amp;2) != 0) || ((n &amp; 7) == 5) || ((n &amp; 11) == 8) )
    return false;
  if( n == 0 )
    return true;

  // Check mod 255 = 3 * 5 * 17, for fun
  long y = n;
  y = (y &amp; 0xffffffffL) + (y &gt;&gt; 32);
  y = (y &amp; 0xffffL) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);
  y = (y &amp; 0xffL) + ((y &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xffL) + (y &gt;&gt; 16);
  if( bad255[(int)y] )
      return false;

  // Divide out powers of 4 using binary search
  if((n &amp; 0xffffffffL) == 0)
      n &gt;&gt;= 32;
  if((n &amp; 0xffffL) == 0)
      n &gt;&gt;= 16;
  if((n &amp; 0xffL) == 0)
      n &gt;&gt;= 8;
  if((n &amp; 0xfL) == 0)
      n &gt;&gt;= 4;
  if((n &amp; 0x3L) == 0)
      n &gt;&gt;= 2;

  if((n &amp; 0x7L) != 1)
      return false;

  // Compute sqrt using something like Hensel's lemma
  long r, t, z;
  r = start[(int)((n &gt;&gt; 3) &amp; 0x3ffL)];
  do {
    z = n - r * r;
    if( z == 0 )
      return true;
    if( z &lt; 0 )
      return false;
    t = z &amp; (-z);
    r += (z &amp; t) &gt;&gt; 1;
    if( r &gt; (t  &gt;&gt; 1) )
    r = t - r;
  } while( t &lt;= (1L &lt;&lt; 33) );
  return false;

<p><strong>Update</strong>:  I've tried the different solutions presented below.</p>

<ul>
<li>After exhaustive testing, I found that adding <code>0.5</code> to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine.</li>
<li>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root"" rel=""noreferrer"">John Carmack hack</a> was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881.  However, as suggested by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/38426/bobbyshaftoe"">BobbyShaftoe</a>, we can use the Carmack hack for n &lt; 410881.</li>
<li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.  This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java.  Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles.</li>
<li>A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>.</li>
<li>Binary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one suggestion which did show improvements was made by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/25188/john-d-cook"">John D. Cook</a>.  You can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9.  This means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares.  Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime.</p>

<p>Working from John's suggestion, I investigated properties of the last <em>n</em> bits of a perfect square.  By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits.  This means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math.  Implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm).  Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical.</p>

<p>Here is the code that I have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers).  For values of <em>n</em> less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>According to John's tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>.</li>
<li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values).  Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>.  To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower.  <del>I'm not sure why.</del>  This is because <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/299079/why-is-this-code-with-several-or-statements-slightly-faster-than-using-a-lookup-t#299205"">array bounds are checked in Java</a>. </li>

<p>I've added this line that users can enter how many results they want shown:</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>How Many: &lt;input ng-model=""quantity""&gt;

<p>Here's my controller:</p>

<pre><code>function PhoneListCtrl($scope, $http) {
  $http.get('phones/phones.json').success(function(data) {
    $scope.phones = data.splice(0, 'quantity');
  });

<p>The important line is:</p>

<pre><code>$scope.phones = data.splice(0, 'quantity');

<p>I can hard-code in a number to represent how many phones should be shown. If I put 5 in, 5 will be shown. All I want to do is read the number in that input from the view, and put that in the data.splice line. I've tried with and without quotes, and neither work. How do I do this?</p>

<p>So for example I have a promise chain within an express app like so:</p>

<pre><code>repository.Query(getAccountByIdQuery)
        .catch(function(error){
            res.status(404).send({ error: ""No account found with this Id"" });
        })
        .then(convertDocumentToModel)
        .then(verifyOldPassword)
        .catch(function(error) {
            res.status(406).send({ OldPassword: error });
        })
        .then(changePassword)
        .then(function(){
            res.status(200).send();
        })
        .catch(function(error){
            console.log(error);
            res.status(500).send({ error: ""Unable to change password"" });
        });
</code></pre>

<p>So the behaviour I am after is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Goes to get account by Id</li>
<li>If there is a rejection at this point, bomb out and return an error</li>
<li>If there is no error convert the document returned to a model</li>
<li>Verify the password with the database document</li>
<li>If the passwords dont match then bomb out and return a different error</li>
<li>If there is no error change the passwords</li>
<li>Then return success</li>
<li>If anything else went wrong, return a 500</li>
</ul>

<p>So currently catches do not seem to stop the chaining, and that makes sense, so I am wondering if there is a way for me to somehow force the chain to stop at a certain point based upon the errors, or if there is a better way to structure this to get some form of branching behaviour, as there is a case of <code>if X do Y else Z</code>.</p>

<p>Any help would be great.</p>

<p>While reading about classes, it goes on to say that in Python there is no need to declare instance variables. You just use them in the constructor, and boom, they are there. </p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>class Simple:
    def __init__(self1, str):
        print(""inside the simple constructor"")
        self1.s = str
    def show(self1):
        print(self1.s)
    def showMsg (self, msg):
        print (msg + ':', self.show())
</code></pre>

<p>If that’s true, then any object of class <code>Simple</code> can just change the value of variable <code>s</code> outside of the class. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<pre><code>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    x = Simple(""constructor argument"")
    x.s = ""test15"" # this changes the value
    x.show()
    x.showMsg(""A message"")
</code></pre>

<p>In Java, we have been taught about public/private/protected variables.  Those keywords make sense because at times you want variables in a class to which no one outside the class has access to. </p>

<p>Why is that not required in Python?</p>

<p>The ComboBox ItemsSource is bound to a property on a ViewModel class that lists a bunch of RAS phonebook entries as a CollectionView. Then I've bound (at separate times) both the <code>SelectedItem</code> or <code>SelectedValue</code> to another property of the ViewModel. I have added a MessageBox into the save command to debug the values set by the databinding, but the <code>SelectedItem</code>/<code>SelectedValue</code> binding is not being set.</p>

<p>The ViewModel class looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public ConnectionViewModel
{
    private readonly CollectionView _phonebookEntries;
    private string _phonebookeEntry;

    public CollectionView PhonebookEntries
    {
        get { return _phonebookEntries; }
    }

    public string PhonebookEntry
    {
        get { return _phonebookEntry; }
        set
        {
            if (_phonebookEntry == value) return;
            _phonebookEntry = value;
            OnPropertyChanged(""PhonebookEntry"");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The _phonebookEntries collection is being initialised in the constructor from a business object. The ComboBox XAML looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=PhonebookEntries}""
    DisplayMemberPath=""Name""
    SelectedValuePath=""Name""
    SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=PhonebookEntry}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am only interested in the actual string value displayed in the ComboBox, not any other properties of the object as this is the value I need to pass across to RAS when I want to make the VPN connection, hence <code>DisplayMemberPath</code> and <code>SelectedValuePath</code> are both the Name property of the ConnectionViewModel. The ComboBox is in a <code>DataTemplate</code> applied to an <code>ItemsControl</code> on a Window who's DataContext  has been set to a ViewModel instance.</p>

<p>The ComboBox displays the list of items correctly, and I can select one in the UI with no problem. However when I display the message box from the command, the PhonebookEntry property still has the initial value in it, not the selected value from the ComboBox. Other TextBox instances are updating fine and displaying in the MessageBox.</p>

<p>What am I missing with databinding the ComboBox? I've done a lot of searching and can't seem to find anything that I'm doing wrong.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is the behaviour I'm seeing, however it's not working for some reason in my particular context.</p>

<p>I have a MainWindowViewModel which has a <code>CollectionView</code> of ConnectionViewModels. In the MainWindowView.xaml file code-behind, I set the DataContext to the MainWindowViewModel. The MainWindowView.xaml has an <code>ItemsControl</code> bound to the collection of ConnectionViewModels. I have a DataTemplate that holds the ComboBox as well as some other TextBoxes. The TextBoxes are bound directly to properties of the ConnectionViewModel using <code>Text=""{Binding Path=ConnectionName}""</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class ConnectionViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}

public class MainWindowViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    // List&lt;ConnectionViewModel&gt;...
    public CollectionView Connections { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The XAML code-behind:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Window1
{
    public Window1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        DataContext = new MainWindowViewModel();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Then XAML:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate x:Key=""listTemplate""&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=PhonebookEntries}""
            DisplayMemberPath=""Name""
            SelectedValuePath=""Name""
            SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=PhonebookEntry}"" /&gt;
        &lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Path=Password}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;

&lt;ItemsControl ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=Connections}""
    ItemTemplate=""{StaticResource listTemplate}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The TextBoxes all bind correctly, and data moves between them and the ViewModel with no trouble. It's only the ComboBox that isn't working.</p>

<p>You are correct in your assumption regarding the PhonebookEntry class.</p>

<p>The assumption I am making is that the DataContext used by my DataTemplate is automatically set through the binding hierarchy, so that I don't have to explicitly set it for each item in the <code>ItemsControl</code>. That would seem a bit silly to me.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is a test implementation that demonstrates the problem, based on the example above.</p>

<p><strong>XAML:</strong></p>

            &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal""&gt;
                &lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Path=Name}"" Width=""50"" /&gt;
                &lt;ComboBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=PhonebookEntries}""
                    DisplayMemberPath=""Name""
                    SelectedValuePath=""Name""
                    SelectedValue=""{Binding Path=PhonebookEntry}""
                    Width=""200""/&gt;
            &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;

<p>If you run that example, you will get the behaviour I'm talking about. The TextBox updates its binding fine when you edit it, but the ComboBox does not. Very confusing seeing as really the only thing I've done is introduce a parent ViewModel.</p>

<p>I am currently labouring under the impression that an item bound to the child of a DataContext has that child as its DataContext. I can't find any documentation that clears this up one way or the other.</p>

<p>I.e.,</p>

<p>Window -> DataContext = MainWindowViewModel <br/>
..Items -> Bound to DataContext.PhonebookEntries <br/>
....Item -> DataContext = PhonebookEntry (implicitly associated)</p>

<p>I don't know if that explains my assumption any better(?).</p>

<hr>

<p>To confirm my assumption, change the binding of the TextBox to be</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Mode=OneWay}"" Width=""50"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this will show the TextBox binding root (which I'm comparing to the DataContext) is the ConnectionViewModel instance.</p>

The server system is built on CodeIgniter, and uses the XML-RPC and XML-RPCS libraries for the webservice component.

<p>As for steps I've taken, I've tried disabling all processing on the server-side, and have rigged it to return a canned response regardless of the input.

<p>The thing is, in a specific application, like, for instance, a twitter-like application, should everything really be inside a generic bundle, like the <a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/2.7/page_creation.html#bundles-configuration"" rel=""noreferrer"">official docs</a> say? </p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this is because when we develop applications, in general, we don't want to highly couple our code to some full-stack glue framework.</p>

<p>I was using only getItem() to instantiate and return my fragments:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public Fragment getItem(int position) {
    return new MyFragment(context, paramters);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This worked well (but as said I can't change the content).</p>

<p>So I found this: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7263291/viewpager-pageradapter-not-updating-the-view"">ViewPager PagerAdapter not updating the View</a></p>

<p>Particulary one in which it's talked about method instantiateItem():</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""My approach is to use the setTag() method for any instantiated view in the instantiateItem() method""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So now I want to implement instantiateItem() in order to do that. But I don't know what I have to return there (return is Object) and what is the relation with getItem(int position)?</p>

<p>Currently I'm using getItem to instantiate the Fragment, is that wrong? But then do I have to put the fragments in instance variable, or not implement getItem() at all...? I just don't understand it.</p>

<p>I tried reading the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/FragmentPagerAdapter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">reference</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>public abstract Fragment getItem (int position)</p>

  <li><p>public Object instantiateItem (ViewGroup container, int position)</p>
  
  <p>Create the page for the given position. The adapter is responsible for adding the view to the container given here, although it only must ensure this is done by the time it returns from finishUpdate(ViewGroup).
  Parameters</p>
  
  <p>container   The containing View in which the page will be shown.

<p><strong>My question is have I totally overbaked this? any alternatives?</strong></p>

<h2>EDIT: Chosen Solution</h2>

<p>I decided to use the Dynamic Linq Library, specifically the Dynamic Query class provided in the LINQSamples.</p>

<p>Code below:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using System.Linq.Dynamic;

namespace ExpressionParser
{
  class Program
  {
    public class Person
    {
      public string Name { get; set; }
      public int Age { get; set; }
      public int Weight { get; set; }
      public DateTime FavouriteDay { get; set; }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
      const string exp = @""(Person.Age &gt; 3 AND Person.Weight &gt; 50) OR Person.Age &lt; 3"";
      var p = Expression.Parameter(typeof(Person), ""Person"");
      var e = System.Linq.Dynamic.DynamicExpression.ParseLambda(new[] { p }, null, exp);
      var bob = new Person
      {
        Name = ""Bob"",
        Age = 30,
        Weight = 213,
        FavouriteDay = new DateTime(2000,1,1)
      };

      var result = e.Compile().DynamicInvoke(bob);
      Console.WriteLine(result);
      Console.ReadKey();
    }
  }
}

<p>Result is of type System.Boolean, and in this instance is TRUE.</p>

<p>This is something that's been bugging me for some time now, but it's reaching a point where it's barely usable now.</p>

<p>My project is starting to have a <em>decent</em> size of 65 Swift files and a few bridged Objective-C files (which are really not the cause of the problem).</p>

<p>It seems like any slight modification to any Swift file (like adding a simple white space in a class that's barely used in the app) will cause the entire Swift files for the specified target to be recompiled.</p>

<p>After a deeper investigation, I've found that what is taking pretty much 100% of the compiler time is the <code>CompileSwift</code> phase where Xcode runs the <code>swiftc</code> command on all Swift files of your target.</p>

<p>I did some further investigation, and if I only keep the app delegate with a default controller the compilation is very fast, but as I was adding more and more of my project files, the compile time was starting to get really slow.</p>

<p>Now with only 65 source files, it takes about 8/10 seconds to compile each time. Not very <em>swift</em> at all.</p>

<p>I haven't seen any post talking about this issue except <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24842995/swift-unwrapping-cause-swift-compile-slowly"">this one</a>, but it was an old version of Xcode 6. So I'm wondering if I'm the only one in that case.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>I've checked a few Swift projects on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitHub</a> like <a href=""https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire"" rel=""noreferrer"">Alamofire</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/mattt/Euler"" rel=""noreferrer"">Euler</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift"" rel=""noreferrer"">CryptoSwift</a>, but none of them had enough Swift files to actually compare. The only project I found that was starting a have <em>decent</em> size was <a href=""https://github.com/Dimillian/SwiftHN"" rel=""noreferrer"">SwiftHN</a>, and even though it only had a dozen source files I was still able to verify the same thing, one simple space and the whole project needed recompilation which was starting to take a little time (2/3 seconds).</p>

<p>Compared to Objective-C code where both analyzer and compilation are blazing fast, this really feels like Swift will never be able to handle big projects, but please tell me I'm wrong.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE With Xcode 6 Beta 7</strong></p>

<p>Still no improvement whatsoever. This is starting to get ridiculous. With the lack of <code>#import</code> in Swift, I really don't see how Apple will ever be able to optimize this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE With Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2</strong></p>

<p>Apple has added <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=22"" rel=""noreferrer"">incremental builds</a> (and many other compiler optimizations). You have to migrate your code to Swift 1.2 to see those benefits, but Apple added a tool in Xcode 6.3 to help you do so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DD0Ba.png"" alt=""Enter image description here""></p>

<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>

<p>Don't rejoice too quickly as I did. The graph solver that they use to make the build incremental is not very well optimised yet.</p>

<p>Indeed first, it doesn't look at function signature changes so if you add a space in the block of one method, all files depending on that class will be recompiled.</p>

<p>Second, it seems to create the tree based on the files that were recompiled even if a change doesn't affect them. For example, if you move these three classes into different files</p>

<pre><code>class FileA: NSObject {
    var foo:String?
}
class FileB: NSObject {
    var bar:FileA?
}
class FileC: NSObject {
    var baz:FileB?
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now if you modify <code>FileA</code>, the compiler will obviously mark <code>FileA</code> to be recompiled. It will also recompile <code>FileB</code> (that would be OK based on the changes to <code>FileA</code>), <strong>but</strong> also <code>FileC</code> because <code>FileB</code> is recompiled, and that is pretty bad because <code>FileC</code> never uses <code>FileA</code> here.</p>

<p>So I hope they improve that dependency tree solver... I've opened a <a href=""http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5853511405273088"" rel=""noreferrer"">radar</a> with this sample code.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE With Xcode 7 beta 5 and Swift 2.0</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday Apple released the beta 5 and inside the release notes we could see:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swift Language &amp; Compiler
  • Incremental builds: changing just the body of a function should no longer cause dependent files to be rebuilt. (15352929)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have given it a try and I must say it is working really (really !) well now. They greatly optimized the incremental builds in swift. </p>

<p>I highly recommend you create a <code>swift2.0</code> branch and keep your code up to date using XCode 7 beta 5. You will be pleased by the enhancements of the compiler (however I'd say the global state of XCode 7 is still slow &amp; buggy)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE With Xcode 8.2</strong></p>

<p>It's been a while since my last update on this issue so here it is.</p>

<p>Our app is now about 20k lines of almost exclusively Swift code, which is decent but not outstanding. It underwent swift 2 and than swift 3 migration. It takes about 5/6m to compile on a mid 2014 Macbook pro (2.5 GHz Intel Core i7) which is okay on a clean build. </p>

<p>However the incremental build is still a joke despite Apple claiming that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Xcode will not rebuild an entire target when only small changes have occurred. (28892475)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously I think many of us just laughed after checking out this nonsense (adding one private (private!) property to any file of my project will recompile the whole thing...)</p>

<p>I would like to point you guys to <a href=""https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/62737"" rel=""noreferrer"">this thread</a> on Apple developer forums which has some more information about the issue (as well as appreciated Apple dev communication on the matter once in a while)</p>

<p>Basically people have come up with a few things to try to improve the incremental build:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a <code>HEADER_MAP_USES_VFS</code> project setting set to <code>true</code></li>
<li>Disable <code>Find implicit dependencies</code> from your scheme</li>
<li>Create a new project and move your files hierarchy to the new one.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will try solution 3 but solution 1/2 didn't work for us.</p>

<p>What's ironically funny in this whole situation is that looking at the first post on this issue we were using Xcode 6 with I believe swift 1 or swift 1.1 code when we reached the first compilations slugginess and now about two years later despite actual improvements from Apple the situation is just as bad as it was with Xcode 6. How ironic.</p>

<p>I actually <strong>REALLY</strong> regret choosing Swift over Obj/C for our project because of the daily frustration it involves. (I even switch to AppCode but that's another story)</p>

<p>Anyways I see this SO post has 32k+ views and 143 ups as of this writing so I guess I'm not the only one. Hang in there guys despite being pessimistic over this situation there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>If you have the time (and courage!) I guess Apple welcomes radar about this.</p>

<p>Til next time ! Cheers</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE With Xcode 9</strong></p>

<p>Stumble upon <a href=""https://github.com/quellish/XcodeNewBuildSystem"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> today. Xcode quietly introduced a new build system to improve on the current awful performance. You have to enable it through the workspace settings.</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;() {{
    add(""vanilla"");
    add(""strawberry"");
    add(""chocolate"");
    add(""butter pecan"");
}};
</code></pre>

<p>This idiom creates an anonymous inner class with just an instance initializer in it, which ""can use any [...] methods in the containing scope"".  </p>

<p>Main question: Is this as <strong>inefficient</strong> as it sounds?  Should its use be limited to one-off initializations?  (And of course showing off!)</p>

<p>Second question: The new HashSet must be the ""this"" used in the instance initializer ... can anyone shed light on the mechanism?  </p>

<p>Third question: Is this idiom too <strong>obscure</strong> to use in production code?</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Very, very nice answers, thanks everyone. On question (3), people felt the syntax should be clear (though I'd recommend an occasional comment, especially if your code will pass on to developers who may not be familiar with it).  </p>

<p>On question (1), the generated code should run quickly. The extra .class files do cause jar file clutter, and slow program startup slightly (thanks to @coobird for measuring that). @Thilo pointed out that garbage collection can be affected, and the memory cost for the extra loaded classes may be a factor in some cases.  </p>

<p>Question (2) turned out to be most interesting to me. If I understand the answers, what's happening in DBI is that the anonymous inner class extends the class of the object being constructed by the new operator, and hence has a ""this"" value referencing the instance being constructed. Very neat.</p>

<p>Overall, DBI strikes me as something of an intellectual curiousity.  Coobird and others point out you can achieve the same effect with Arrays.asList, varargs methods, Google Collections, and the proposed Java 7 Collection literals.  Newer JVM languages like Scala, JRuby, and Groovy also offer concise notations for list construction, and interoperate well with Java.  Given that DBI clutters up the classpath, slows down class loading a bit, and makes the code a tad more obscure, I'd probably shy away from it. However, I plan to spring this on a friend who's just gotten his SCJP and loves good natured jousts about Java semantics!  ;-)  Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>7/2017: Baeldung <a href=""http://www.baeldung.com/java-double-brace-initialization"" rel=""noreferrer"">has a good summary</a> of double brace initialization and considers it an anti-pattern.</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; flavors = Set.of(""vanilla"", ""strawberry"", ""chocolate"", ""butter pecan"");

<p>How can I achieve this?</p>

<hr>

<p>Based on the answers posted so far, I am currently doing this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method=""get"" action=""/page2""&gt;
    &lt;button type=""submit""&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<p>but the problem with this is that in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_%28web_browser%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Safari</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Internet&nbsp;Explorer</a>, it adds a question mark character to the end of the URL. I need to find a solution that doesn't add any characters to the end of the URL.</p>

<p>There are two other solutions to do this: Using JavaScript or styling a link to look like a button.</p>

<p>Using JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=""window.location.href='/page2'""&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this obviously requires JavaScript, and for that reason it is less accessible to screen readers. The point of a link is to go to another page. So trying to make a button act like a link is the wrong solution. My suggestion is that you should use a link and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710089/how-do-i-make-an-html-link-look-like-a-button"">style it to look like a button</a>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""/link/to/page2""&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Yes, you can render PDF's very easily with a <code>UIWebView</code> but this cant give the performance and functionality that you would expect from a good PDF viewer.</p>

<p>You can draw a PDF page <a href=""http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/196313-display-pdf-in-calayer.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">to a CALayer</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3831304/calayer-and-off-screen-rendering/3853778#3853778""> to a UIImage</a>. Apple even have sample code to show how draw a large PDF <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/ZoomingPDFViewer/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40010281"" rel=""noreferrer"">in a Zoomable UIScrollview</a></p>

<p>But the same issues keep cropping up.</p>

<p><strong>UIImage Method:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>PDF's in a <code>UIImage</code> don't optically
scale as well as a Layer approach.</li>
<li>The CPU and memory hit on generating
the <code>UIImages</code> from a <code>PDFcontext</code>
limits/prevents using it to create a
real-time render of new zoom-levels.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>CATiledLayer Method:</strong></p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Theres a significant Overhead (time)
drawing a full PDF page to a <code>CALayer</code>: individual tiles can be seen rendering (even with a tileSize tweak)</li>
<li><code>CALayers</code> cant be prepared ahead  of
    time (rendered off-screen).</li>
</ol>

<p>Generally PDF viewers are pretty heavy on memory too. Even monitor the memory usage of apple's zoomable PDF example.</p>

<p>In my current project, I'm developing a PDF viewer and am rendering a <code>UIImage</code> of a page in a separate thread (issues here too!) and presenting it while the scale is x1. <code>CATiledLayer</code> rendering kicks in once the scale is >1.  iBooks takes a similar double take approach as if you scroll the pages you can see a lower res version of the page for just less than a second before a crisp version appears.</p>

<p>Im rendering 2 pages each side of the page in focus so that the PDF image is ready to mask the layer before it starts drawing.Pages are destroyed again when they are +2 pages away from the focused page.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have any insights, no matter how small or obvious to improve the performance/ memory handling of Drawing PDF's? or any other issues discussed here?</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong> Some Tips (Credit- Luke Mcneice,VdesmedT,Matt Gallagher,Johann):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Save any media to disk when you can.</p></li>
<li><p>Use larger tileSizes if rendering on TiledLayers</p></li>
<li><p>init frequently used arrays with placeholder objects, alternitively another design approach is <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/01/multiple-virtual-pages-in-uiscrollview.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one</a></p></li>
<li><p>Note that images will render faster than a <code>CGPDFPageRef</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>NSOperations</code> or GCD &amp; <a href=""http://thirdcog.eu/pwcblocks/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blocks</a> to prepare pages ahead
of time.</p></li>
<li><p>call <code>CGContextSetInterpolationQuality(ctx, kCGInterpolationHigh); CGContextSetRenderingIntent(ctx, kCGRenderingIntentDefault);</code> before <code>CGContextDrawPDFPage</code> to reduce memory usage while drawing </p></li>
<li><p>init'ing your <code>NSOperations</code> with a docRef is a bad idea (memory), wrap the docRef into a singleton.</p></li>
<li><p>Cancel needless <code>NSOperations</code> When you can, especially if they will be using memory, beware of leaving contexts open though!</p></li>
<li><p>Recycle page objects and destroy unused views</p></li>
<li><p>Close any open Contexts as soon as you don't need them</p></li>
<li><p>on receiving memory warnings release and reload the DocRef and any page Caches</p></li>

<p>These days, I am thinking maybe <em>Runtime</em> has something in common with the so called <em>Virtual Machine</em>, such as JVM. Here's the quotation that leads to such thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This compilation process is sufficiently complex to be broken into
  several layers of abstraction, and these usually involve three

<p>The output that I am getting is <code>29 years 8 months 24 days 12 hours 0 minutes 50 seconds</code>. I have checked my result from this <a href=""http://www.epochconverter.com/epoch/date-difference.php"">website</a> (with values <code>12/16/1984 07:45:55</code> and <code>09/09/2014 19:46:45</code>). The following screenshot shows the output:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAJE4.png"" alt=""Epoch Converter""></p>

<p>I am pretty sure that the fields after the month value is coming wrong from my code. Any suggestion would be very helpful.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I have tested my result from another website and the result I got is different. Here it is: <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=16&amp;m1=12&amp;y1=1984&amp;d2=9&amp;m2=9&amp;y2=2014&amp;h1=7&amp;i1=45&amp;s1=55&amp;h2=19&amp;i2=46&amp;s2=45"">Calculate duration between two dates</a> (result: 29 years, 8 months, 24 days, 12 hours, 0 minutes and 50 seconds).</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Since I got two different results from two different sites, I am wondering if the algorithm of my calculation is legitimate or not. If I use following two <code>LocalDateTime</code> objects:</p>

<pre><code>LocalDateTime toDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(2014, 9, 10, 6, 40, 45);
LocalDateTime fromDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(1984, 12, 16, 7, 45, 55);
</code></pre>

<p>Then the output is coming: <code>29 years 8 months 25 days -1 hours -5 minutes -10 seconds.</code></p>

<p>From this <a href=""http://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?d1=16&amp;m1=12&amp;y1=1984&amp;d2=10&amp;m2=9&amp;y2=2014&amp;h1=7&amp;i1=45&amp;s1=55&amp;h2=6&amp;i2=40&amp;s2=45"">link</a> it should be <code>29 years 8 months 24 days 22 hours, 54 minutes and 50 seconds</code>. So the algorithm needs to handle the negative numbers too.</p>

<p><strong>Note the question is not about which site gave me what result, I need to know the right algorithm and need to have right results.</strong></p>

<p>This works fine. Now I want a timer counting the seconds/minutes of the progress of the song. So I put a <code>TextView</code> in the layout, get it with <code>findViewById()</code> in <code>onCreate()</code>, and put this in <code>run()</code> after <code>progress.setProgress(pos)</code>:</p>

<pre><code>String time = String.format(""%d:%d"",

currentTime.setText(time);  // currentTime = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.current_time);

<p>But that last line gives me the exception:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yet I'm doing basically the same thing here as I'm doing with the <code>SeekBar</code> - creating the view in <code>onCreate</code>, then touching it in <code>run()</code> - and it doesn't give me this complaint.</p>

<p>The <code>tar --exclude=PATTERN</code> command matches the given pattern and excludes those files, but I need specific files &amp; folders to be ignored (full file path), otherwise valid files might be excluded.</p>

<p>I could also use the find command to create a list of files and exclude the ones I don't want to archive and pass the list to tar, but that only works with for a small amount of files. I have tens of thousands.</p>

Most (if not all) of them depend on Hibernate, but I'd like to discuss them JPA-implementation-neutrally (I am using EclipseLink, by the way).</p>

<p>All possible implementations are having their own <strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>disadvantages</strong> regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code></strong> contract <strong>conformity</strong> (immutability) for <code>List</code>/<code>Set</code> operations</li>
<li>Whether <strong>identical</strong> objects (e.g. from different sessions, dynamic proxies from lazily-loaded data structures) can be detected</li>
<li>Whether entities behave correctly in <strong>detached (or non-persisted) state</strong> 
<br></li>
</ul>

<p>As far I can see, there are <strong>three options</strong>: </p>

<ol>
<li>Do not override them; rely on <code>Object.equals()</code> and <code>Object.hashCode()</code>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> work</li>
<li>cannot identify identical objects, problems with dynamic proxies</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>primary key</strong>

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Override them, based on the <strong>Business-Id</strong> (non-primary key fields; what about foreign keys?)

<ul>
<li><code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken</li>
<li>correct identity (for all managed entities)</li>
<li>no problems with detached entities</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>My questions are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Did I miss an option and/or pro/con point?<br></li>
<li>What option did you choose and why?</li>
</ol>

<p><br><br>
<strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>By ""<code>hashCode()</code>/<code>equals()</code> are broken"", I mean that successive <code>hashCode()</code> invocations may return differing values, which is (when correctly implemented) not broken in the sense of the <code>Object</code> API documentation, but which causes problems when trying to retrieve a changed entity from a <code>Map</code>,  <code>Set</code> or other hash-based <code>Collection</code>.  Consequently, JPA implementations (at least EclipseLink) will not work correctly in some cases.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your answers -- most of them have remarkable quality.<br>
Unfortunately, I am still unsure which approach will be the best for a real-life application, or how to determine the best approach for my application.  So, I'll keep the question open and hope for some more discussions and/or opinions.</p>

<li>Can the message be customized if you are returning concrete domain model?     </li>

<li>Should I be throwing an exception or returning error response? If the answer is ""it depends"", can you give situations/examples on when to use one vs the other. </li>
<li>What is the difference between throwing <code>HttpResponseException</code> vs <code>Request.CreateErrorResponse</code> ? The output to client seems identical...</li>
<li>Should I always use <code>HttpError</code> to ""wrap"" response messages in errors (whether the exception is thrown or error response returned)?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd like to bind a select element to a list of objects -- which is easy enough:</p>

<pre><code>@Component({
   selector: 'myApp',
   template: `&lt;h1&gt;My Application&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;select [(ngModel)]=""selectedValue""&gt;
                 &lt;option *ngFor=""#c of countries"" value=""c.id""&gt;{{c.name}}&lt;/option&gt;
              &lt;/select&gt;`
})
export class AppComponent{
    countries = [
       {id: 1, name: ""United States""},
       {id: 2, name: ""Australia""}
       {id: 3, name: ""Canada""}
       {id: 4, name: ""Brazil""}
       {id: 5, name: ""England""}
     ];
    selectedValue = null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, it appears that selectedValue would be a number -- the id of the selected item.</p>

<p>However, I'd actually like to bind to the country object itself so that selectedValue is the object rather than just the id.  I tried changing the value of the option like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;option *ngFor=""#c of countries"" value=""c""&gt;{{c.name}}&lt;/option&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but this does not seem to work.  It seems to place an object in my selectedValue -- but not the object that I'm expecting.  You can <a href=""http://plnkr.co/edit/HGRGv33EFwxDsSnELofk?p=preview"" rel=""noreferrer"">see this in my Plunker example</a>.</p>

<p>I also tried binding to the change event so that I could set the object myself based on the selected id; however, it appears that the change event fires before the bound ngModel is updated -- meaning I don't have access to the newly selected value at that point.</p>

<p>Is there a clean way to bind a select element to an object with Angular 2?</p>

<p>Okay, I tried J.N.'s suggestion of trying having Python store the line read: but it made no difference to python's speed.</p>

<p>I also tried J.N.'s suggestion of using <code>scanf</code> into a <code>char</code> array instead of <code>getline</code> into a <code>std::string</code>. Bingo! This resulted in equivalent performance for both Python and C++. (3,333,333 LPS with my input data, which by the way are just short lines of three fields each, usually about 20 characters wide, though sometimes more).</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>char input_a[512];
char input_b[32];
char input_c[512];
while(scanf(""%s %s %s\n"", input_a, input_b, input_c) != EOF) {
    line_count++;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Speed:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat test_lines | ./readline_test_cpp2
Read 10000000 lines in 3 seconds. LPS: 3333333
$ cat test_lines | ./readline_test2.py
Read 10000000 lines in 3 seconds. LPS: 3333333
</code></pre>

<p>(Yes, I ran it several times.) So, I guess I will now use <code>scanf</code> instead of <code>getline</code>. But, I'm still curious if people think this performance hit from <code>std::string</code>/<code>getline</code> is typical and reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 4 (was: Final Edit / Solution):</strong></p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<pre><code>cin.sync_with_stdio(false);

<p>Thanks to @Vaughn Cato for his answer! <strong><em>Any elaboration people can make or good references people can point to as to why this synchronisation happens, what it means, when it's useful, and when it's okay to disable would be greatly appreciated by posterity.</em></strong> :-)</p>

<p><strong>Edit 5 / Better Solution:</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by Gandalf The Gray below, <code>gets</code> is even faster than <code>scanf</code> or the unsynchronized <code>cin</code> approach. I also learned that <a href=""http://c-faq.com/stdio/scanfprobs.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>scanf</code></a> and <a href=""http://c-faq.com/stdio/getsvsfgets.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>gets</code></a> are both UNSAFE and should NOT BE USED due to potential of buffer overflow. So, I wrote this iteration using <code>fgets</code>, the safer alternative to gets. Here are the pertinent lines for my fellow noobs:</p>

<pre><code>char input_line[MAX_LINE];
char *result;

//&lt;snip&gt;

while((result = fgets(input_line, MAX_LINE, stdin )) != NULL)
    line_count++;
if (ferror(stdin))
    perror(""Error reading stdin."");
</code></pre>

<p>Now, here are the results using an even larger file (100M lines; ~3.4&nbsp;GB) on a fast server with very fast disk, comparing the Python code, the unsynchronised <code>cin</code>, and the <code>fgets</code> approaches, as well as comparing with the wc utility. [The <code>scanf</code> version segmentation faulted and I don't feel like troubleshooting it.]:</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test.py

Recap (lines per second):
python:         3,571,428
cin (no sync): 12,500,000
fgets:         14,285,714
wc:            54,644,808
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, <code>fgets</code> is better, but still pretty far from wc performance; I'm pretty sure this is due to the fact that wc examines each character without any memory copying. I suspect that, at this point, other parts of the code will become the bottleneck, so I don't think optimizing to that level would even be worthwhile, even if possible (since, after all, I actually need to store the read lines in memory).</p>

<p>Also note that a small tradeoff with using a <code>char *</code> buffer and <code>fgets</code> vs. unsynchronised <code>cin</code> to string is that the latter can read lines of any length, while the former requires limiting input to some finite number.  In practice, this is probably a non-issue for reading most line-based input files, as the buffer can be set to a very large value that would not be exceeded by valid input.</p>

<p>This has been educational. Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong></p>

<p>As suggested by J.F. Sebastian in the comments below, the GNU wc utility uses plain C <code>read()</code> (within the safe-read.c wrapper) to read chunks (of 16k bytes) at a time and count new lines. Here's a Python equivalent based on J.F.'s code (just showing the relevant snippet that replaces the Python <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>BUFFER_SIZE = 16384
count = sum(chunk.count('\n') for chunk in iter(partial(sys.stdin.read, BUFFER_SIZE), ''))
</code></pre>

<p>The performance of this version is quite fast (though still a bit slower than the raw C wc utility, of course):</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test3.py
0.01user 1.16system 0:04.74elapsed 24%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2448maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+181minor)pagefaults 0swaps
Read 100000000 lines in 4.7275 seconds. LPS: 21152829
</code></pre>

<p>Again, it's a bit silly for me to compare C++ <code>fgets</code>/<code>cin</code> and the first python code on the one hand to <code>wc -l</code> and this last Python snippet on the other, as the latter two don't actually store the read lines, but merely count newlines. Still, it's interesting to explore all the different implementations and think about the performance implications. Thanks again!</p>

<p><strong>Edit 7: Tiny benchmark addendum and recap</strong></p>

<p>For completeness, I thought I'd update the read speed for the same file on the same box with the original (synced) C++ code. Again, this is for a 100M line file on a fast disk. Here's the complete table now:</p>

<pre><code>Implementation      Lines per second
python (default)           3,571,428
cin (default/naive)          819,672
cin (no sync)             12,500,000
fgets                     14,285,714
wc (not fair comparison)  54,644,808

Visual Studio is <em>typically</em> painfully slow to debug or just plain load (""start without debugging"") my ASP.NET MVC sites. Not always: at first, the projects will load nice and fast, but once they load slow, they'll always load slow after that. I could be waiting 1-2 minutes or more.</p>

<p><strong>My setup:</strong></p>

<p>I'm using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_Express"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visual Studio 2012 Express</a>, currently, but I've had the same problem in Visual Studio 2010 Express as well. My solution is stored on a network drive; specifically, it's My Documents redirected to a network drive, if it matters. (It shouldn't. There are times where my site loads very fast under this setup.)</p>

<p>I load in Internet&nbsp;Explorer 9 usually, but the same problem happens in Firefox.</p>

<p>This can happen in any ASP.NET MVC project I work on, and it seems to revolve around having DisplayTemplates, which all my ASP.NET MVC projects do. And it's all C# and Razor, if that mattered.</p>

<h3>Symptoms:</h3>

<p>The system will load my symbols <em>hundreds</em> of times. Basically, the following, but there are at least 300 such rows, each with ever-so-slightly different DLL files for the same CSHTMLs:</p>

<pre><code>'iisexpress.exe' (Managed (v4.0.30319)): Loaded 'C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files\root\b63f8236\6775085d\App_Web_contact.cshtml.22013bb9.xighmhow.dll', Symbols loaded.

</code></pre>

<p>In the above, I've got three DisplayTemplates: ""Contact"", ""Location"", and ""StatusCode"". It appears that IIS is loading symbols twice for each time the displaytemplate gets called. Thus, if I'm displaying a table of 100 entries that calls all three of these displaytemplates, it's 600 separate symbols loaded.</p>

<p>This isn't a fast operation either. Looking in the log files that IIS generates, it takes about 200&nbsp;ms for each symbol to load. Thus, super-long delays.</p>

<p><strong>What I've Tried:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Debug or Release version, it doesn't matter.</li>
<li>Putting my project on a full IIS implementation on a web server runs it super fast with no problems.</li>
<li>Cassini, IIS&nbsp;Express 7.5, and IIS&nbsp;Express 8.0 all have the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Delete All Breakpoints does nothing.</strong></li>
<li><em>Clean Solution</em>, or deleting the .suo also do nothing.</li>
<li>If I repair IIS&nbsp;Express, or delete the <code>My Docs\IISExpress</code> folder, or repair/reinstall Visual Studio → the issue MAY go away, but only for a while, before it comes right back.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any advice at all is appreciated.</p>

<p>To answer more questions, yes my machine definitely has the horsepower. The infuriating thing is that the same project, with NOTHING altered, can load very very quickly sometimes, typically after I repair IIS&nbsp;Express and delete the <code>My Docs\IISExpress</code> folder. Eventually ""something"" happens and it's down to 2 minutes to load again. What I'm working on is not a complicated project. No external libraries or dependencies, and my VS.NET has no addons what-so-ever.</p>

<p>Of note, this machine has Symantec Endpoint Protection, which has a history of causing havoc. But disabling it outright (it's good to be an administrator) did not fix the problem.</p>

<p>I have a theory at this point. I'm thinking this is all because I'm working off a redirected folder off a network share. While the debugger was going through its hundreds of ""loaded symbols"" lines, I paused to see what it was doing. It was in my code, loading the DisplayTemplate I had. Stepping into the template output this:</p>

<p>It looks like Visual Studio is recompiling my displaytemplate <strong>every time</strong> it's called, which is again, hundreds of times. My theory is that Visual Studio compiles the file, saves it to the network share, the network share then somehow stamps a new time on it, and Visual Studio then thinks the file has changed and thus Visual Studio recompiles it yet again. Only a theory though; I really have no clue.</p>

<p>For one, apparently I have offline files on (this is a desktop computer in an office; I couldn't care less). I'm going to disable, reboot and retry tomorrow.</p>

<p>Plus, moving my project, as is, to the local C: fixes it. It loads very quickly. But this is not ideal in a work environment. I lose Previous Versions, my code isn't backed up at all unless I manually copy it, and it's no longer shared with anyone.</p>

<p>I can make do with copying it back and forth from C to the network share, if it comes to it. It's much more annoying to wait two minutes for every page load.</p>

<p>I understand why this happens, and I also know that I could get rid of that space by removing the white-space between the SPAN elements in the HTML source code, like so:</p>

<p>However, I was hoping for a CSS solution that doesn't require the HTML source code to be tampered with.</p>

<p>I know how to solve this with JavaScript - by removing the text nodes from the container element (the paragraph), like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// jQuery
$('p').contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }).remove();
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can tell the problem is with the mysql2 gem. MySQL seems to be running fine and my Gemfile references mysql2, my database.yml file seems ok also.</p>

<p>The error mentions</p>

<p>MySQL2.bundle is there!?</p>

<p>If I use the old mysql gem, WEBrick boots fine. But that's not ideal, is it?</p>

<p>I've tried everything google can give me! Any help much appreciated.</p>

<p>Using the built-in terminal of IntelliJ, executing <code>git -c core.quotepath=false fetch origin --progress --prune</code>, it works just as it should.</p>

<p>According to the stacktrace, there seems to be a problem with my <code>KnownHosts</code>, so I deleted our git server from <code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code>, hoping IntelliJ would insert it again. But the problem still appears when updating via the UI, and there is no new entry written in <code>known_hosts</code>; thinking about some caching of the file, I restarted IntelliJ, without success.</p>

<p>When doing another <code>git fetch</code> from the terminal, now I'm getting asked if I want to permanently add the server. After that, it has been written to <code>known_hosts</code> again, but IntelliJ still won't let me update my project.</p>

<p>I haven't found anything about this behavior online, so I guess it's not a known bug with the new IntelliJ version. Nevertheless, I updated to 14.0.2, but the problem still exists.</p>

<p>IntelliJ is configured to use the built-in SSH executable.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a clue what could be the problem here?</p>

<p>I'm trying to accomplish the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Submit a POST that contains JSON data to a REST url.</li>
<li>If the request specifies a JSON response, then JSON is returned.</li>
<li>If the request specifies a PDF/XLS/etc response, then a downloadable binary is returned.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have 1 &amp; 2 working now, and the client jquery app displays the returned data in the web page by creating DOM elements based on the JSON data. I also have #3 working from the web-service point of view, meaning it will create and return a binary file if given the correct JSON parameters. But I'm unsure the best way to deal with #3 in the client javascript code.</p>

<p>Is it possible to get a downloadable file back from an ajax call like this? How do I get the browser to download and save the file?</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: ""POST"",
    url: ""/services/test"",
    contentType: ""application/json"",
    data: JSON.stringify({category: 42, sort: 3, type: ""pdf""}),
    dataType: ""json"",
    success: function(json, status){
        if (status != ""success"") {
            log(""Error loading data"");
            return;
        }
        log(""Data loaded!"");
    },
    error: function(result, status, err) {
        log(""Error loading data"");
        return;
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>The server responds with the following headers:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Disposition:attachment; filename=export-1282022272283.pdf
Content-Length:5120
Content-Type:application/pdf
Server:Jetty(6.1.11)
</code></pre>

<p>Another idea is to generate the PDF and store it on the server and return JSON that includes a URL to the file. Then, issue another call in the ajax success handler to do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>success: function(json,status) {
    window.location.href = json.url;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But doing that means I would need to make more than one call to the server, and my server would need to build downloadable files, store them somewhere, then periodically clean up that storage area.</p>

<p>There must be a simpler way to accomplish this. Ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: After reviewing the docs for $.ajax, I see that the response dataType can only be one of <code>xml, html, script, json, jsonp, text</code>, so I'm guessing there is no way to directly download a file using an ajax request, unless I embed the binary file in using Data URI scheme as suggested in the @VinayC answer (which is not something I want to do).</p>

<p>So I guess my options are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not use ajax and instead submit a form post and embed my JSON data into the form values. Would probably need to mess with hidden iframes and such.</p></li>
<li><p>Not use ajax and instead convert my JSON data into a query string to build a standard GET request and set window.location.href to this URL. May need to use event.preventDefault() in my click handler to keep browser from changing from the application URL.</p></li>
<li><p>Use my other idea above, but enhanced with suggestions from the @naikus answer. Submit AJAX request with some parameter that lets web-service know this is being called via an ajax call. If the web service is called from an ajax call, simply return JSON with a URL to the generated resource. If the resource is called directly, then return the actual binary file.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I like the last option. This way I can get information back about the request (time to generate, size of file, error messages, etc.) and I can act on that information before starting the download. The downside is extra file management on the server.</p>

<p>Any other ways to accomplish this? Any pros/cons to these methods I should be aware of?</p>

<p><strong>Revised:</strong> update from the answer below, so the actual question I want to solve is -- how to mount host volumes into docker containers in Dockerfile during build, i.e., having the <code>docker run -v /export:/export</code> capability during <code>docker build</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Latest Update:</strong> There is a solution now. Although it is not strictly Docker, but ""<em>it solves all the weak points of Dockerfile</em>"", so I think it is the perfect answer. Check my latest answer for details.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> So the answer is ""Not possible"". I can accept it as an answer as I know the issue has been extensively discussed at <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3156"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3156</a>. I can understand that portability is a paramount issue for docker developer; but as a docker user, I have to say I'm very disappointed about this missing feature. Let me close my argument with a quote from aforementioned discussion: ""<em>I would like to use Gentoo as a base image but definitely don't want > 1GB of Portage tree data to be in any of the layers once the image has been built. You could have some nice a compact containers if it wasn't for the gigantic portage tree having to appear in the image during the install.</em>"" Yes, I can use wget or curl to download whatever I need, but the fact that merely a portability consideration is now forcing me to download > 1GB of Portage tree each time I build a Gentoo base image is neither efficient nor user friendly. Further more, the package repository WILL ALWAYS be under /usr/portage, thus ALWAYS PORTABLE under Gentoo. Again, I respect the decision, but please allow me expressing my disappointment as well in the mean time. Thanks.</p>

<p>Original question in details:</p>

<p>From </p>

<a href=""http://docker.readthedocs.org/en/v0.7.3/use/working_with_volumes/"">http://docker.readthedocs.org/en/v0.7.3/use/working_with_volumes/</a></p>

<p>it says that Data volumes feature ""have been available since version 1 of the Docker Remote API"". My docker is of version 1.2.0, but I found the example given in above article not working:</p>

<pre><code># BUILD-USING:        docker build -t data .
# RUN-USING:          docker run -name DATA data
FROM          busybox
VOLUME        [""/var/volume1"", ""/var/volume2""]
CMD           [""/usr/bin/true""]
</code></pre>

<p>What's the proper way in Dockerfile to mount host-mounted volumes into docker containers,  via the VOLUME command?</p>

<pre><code>object Bar {

      case _:Int =&gt; println(""int"")

<p>This approach requires that we surrender static type checking on the arguments to <code>foo</code>. It would be much nicer to be able to write</p>

<pre><code>object Bar {

implicit def r2Or[L,R](r: R): L or R = Right(r)

      case Right(r) =&gt; println(""int"")

}

<p>It looks like a general (elegant, efficient) solution would require defining <code>Either3</code>, <code>Either4</code>, ....  Does anyone know of an alternate solution to achieve the same end? To my knowledge, Scala does not have built-in ""type disjunction"". Also, are the implicit conversions defined above lurking in the standard library somewhere so that I can just import them?</p>

<p>In this example, using Redux, <em>components/app-product-form.js</em> calls <code>this.props.addProduct(props)</code> when a user submits the form. When the server returns a success, the user is taken to the Cart page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thread lifecycle overhead. Thread creation and teardown are not free. The actual overhead varies across platforms, but thread creation takes time, introducing latency into request processing, and requires some processing activity by the JVM and OS.

<p>The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a <code>UnicodeEncodeError</code>. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.</p>

<p>One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()

<p>I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.</p>

  <p>There are two possible outcomes when a remote procedure call throws TransactionTooLargeException.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
The answers so far all argue that it is meaningless to compare NaNs.</p>

<p>I agree, but that doesn't mean that the correct answer is false,
rather it would be a Not-a-Boolean (NaB), which fortunately doesn't exist.</p>

<p>So the choice of returning true or false for comparisons is in my view arbitrary,
and for general data processing it would be advantageous if it obeyed the usual laws
(reflexivity of ==, trichotomy of &lt;, ==, >),
lest data structures which rely on these laws become confused.</p>

<p>So I'm asking for some concrete advantage of breaking these laws, not just philosophical reasoning.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong>
I think I understand now why making NaN maximal would be a bad idea, it would mess up the computation of upper limits.</p>

<p>NaN != NaN might be desirable to avoid detecting convergence in a loop such as</p>

<pre><code>while (x != oldX) {
    oldX = x;
    x = better_approximation(x);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which however should better be written by comparing the absolute difference with a small limit.
So IMHO this is a relatively weak argument for breaking reflexivity at NaN.</p>

At the bottom of the <code>scrollView</code> I have a <code>listView</code> which is then populated by an adapter.</p>

<p>The problem that I am experiencing, is that android is excluding the <code>listView</code> from the <code>scrollView</code> as the <code>scrollView</code> already has a scroll-able function.  I want the <code>listView</code> to be as long as the content is and for the master scroll view to be scroll-able.</p>

<p>How can I achieve this behavior?</p>

        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:orientation=""vertical"" &gt;
    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;

&lt;/ScrollView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then programmatically add my components to the linearlayour with the id: <code>foodItemActvity_linearLayout_fragments</code>.  Below is one of the views that is loaded into that linearlayout. This is the one giving me trouble with the scrolls.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:orientation=""vertical"" &gt;

    &lt;TextView
       android:id=""@+id/fragment_dds_review_textView_label""
       android:layout_width=""wrap_content""
       android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
       android:text=""Reviews:""
       android:textAppearance=""?android:attr/textAppearanceMedium"" /&gt;

       android:layout_width=""match_parent""
       android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;
   &lt;/ListView&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My adapter then fills up this list view.</p>

<p>This will print the result <code>0.020000000000000004</code> while it should just print <code>0.02</code> (if you use your calculator). As far as I understood this is due to errors in the floating point multiplication precision.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good solution so that in such case I get the correct result <code>0.02</code>? I know there are functions like <code>toFixed</code> or rounding would be another possibility, but I'd like to really have the whole number printed without any cutting and rounding. Just wanted to know if one of you has some nice, elegant solution.</p>

<p>Of course, otherwise I'll round to some 10 digits or so.</p>

The source code tree includes a bunch of mp3 files (the website will be for a recording project I was heavily involved with). </p>

<p>I'd like to put the source code for it up on <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">GitHub</a>, but GitHub has a 300 MB limit on their free accounts.  I don't want to use 50 MB of my limit on a bunch of mp3 files.  Obviously, I could add them to the <code>.gitignore</code> file to keep them out of my repo.</p>

<p>However, I deploy to Heroku using <code>git push heroku</code>.  The mp3 files must be present in the branch I push to Heroku so that they get get deployed.</p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to <code>.gitignore</code> the mp3 files in my local master branch so that when I push that to GitHub, the mp3s are not included.  Then I'd keep a local production branch that has the mp3s committed rather than ignored.  To deploy, I would merge master into production, and then push the production branch to Heroku.</p>

<p>I can't get this to work right.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what I'm trying to do...</p>

<pre><code>$ git init git-ignore-test
$ cd git-ignore-test
$ echo ""*.ignored"" &gt;&gt; .gitignore
$ git add .gitignore &amp;&amp; git commit -m ""Ignore .ignored files""
$ touch Foo.ignored
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, Foo.ignored is ignored in my master branch, but it's still present, so my project can use it.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b unignored
$ cat /dev/null &gt; .gitignore
$ git add Foo.ignored .gitignore &amp;&amp; git commit -m ""Unignore .ignored files""
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've got a branch with these files committed, as I want.  However, when I switch back to my master branch, Foo.ignored is gone.</p>

<p>Anyone got any suggestions for a better way to set this up?</p>

<p>Edit: just to clarify, I want the mp3 files to be present in both branches so that when I run the site locally (using either branch) the site works.  I just want the files ignored in one branch so when I push to GitHub they are not pushed as well.  Usually .gitignore works well for this kind of thing (i.e. keeping a local copy of a file that does not get included in a push to a remote), but when I switch to the branch with the files checked in, and then back to the branch with the files ignored, the files vanish.</p>

Good idea?","<cqrs><event-sourcing><apache-kafka><dddd>","<p>Although I've come across <a href=""http://kafka.apache.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kafka</a> before, I just recently realized Kafka may perhaps be used as (the basis of) a <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">CQRS</a>, <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">eventstore</a>.</p>

<p>One of the main points that Kafka supports:</p>

<ul>
<li>Event capturing / storing, all HA of course.</li>
<li>Pub / sub architecture</li>
<li>Ability to replay the eventlog which allows the ability for new subscribers to register with the system after the fact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Admittedly I'm not 100% versed into CQRS / Event sourcing but this seems pretty close to what an eventstore should be. Funny thing is: I really can't find that much about Kafka being used as an eventstore, so perhaps I must be missing something.</p>

<p>So, anything missing from Kafka for it to be a good eventstore? Would it work? Using it production? Interested in insight, links, etc.</p>

<p>Basically the state of the system is saved based on the transactions/events the system has ever received, instead of just saving the current state / snapshot of the system which is what is usually done. (Think of it as a General Ledger in Accounting: all transactions ultimately add up to the final state) This allows all kinds of cool things, but just read up on the links provided.</p>

<p>Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.

                    View.MeasureSpec.makeMeasureSpec(0, View.MeasureSpec.UNSPECIFIED),

                    break;

            }

            setMeasuredDimension(width, height);
        }

        private void measureScrapChild(RecyclerView.Recycler recycler, int position, int widthSpec,
                                       int heightSpec, int[] measuredDimension) {
            View view = recycler.getViewForPosition(position);
            if (view != null) {
                RecyclerView.LayoutParams p = (RecyclerView.LayoutParams) view.getLayoutParams();
                int childWidthSpec = ViewGroup.getChildMeasureSpec(widthSpec,

    }
</code></pre>

<p>However <strong>this did not work</strong> because </p>

<p><code>heightSize = View.MeasureSpec.getSize(heightSpec);</code> </p>

<p>returns a very large value that appear to be related to <code>match_parent</code>. </p>

<p>By commenting  <code>height = heightSize;</code> (in the second switch case) I managed to make the height work but only if a <code>TextView</code> child inside the <code>CardView</code> does not wrap its own text (a long sentence). </p>

<p>As soon as that <code>TextView</code> wraps it's own text the height SHOULD increase but it doesn't. It calculated the height for that long sentence as a single line, not a wrapped line (2 or more). </p>

<p>Any advice on how I should improve this <code>LayoutManager</code> so my <code>RecyclerView</code> works with <code>WRAP_CONTENT</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: This layout manager might work for most people, but it still has problems with scrolling and calculating heights of wrapping textviews</strong></p>

<p>Hehe, for every step I take in the Android world I run into some sort of problem =(</p>

<p>Apparently, you cannot quit an application in Android (but the Android system can very well totally destroy your app whenever it feels like it). What's up with that? I am starting to think that it's impossible to write an app that functions as a ""normal app"" - that the user can quit the app when he/she decides to do so. That is not something that should be relied upon the OS to do.</p>

<p>The application I am trying to create is not an application for the Android Market. It is not an application for ""wide use"" by the general public, it is a business app that is going to be used in a very narrow business field.</p>

<p>I was actually really looking forward to developing for the Android platform, since it addresses a lot of issues that exist in Windows Mobile and .NET. However, the last week has been somewhat of a turnoff for me... I hope I don't have to abandon Android, but it doesn't look very good right now =(</p>

<p>Is there a way for me to <b>really</b> quit the application?</p>

<li><p>I noticed that if I use <code>IEnumerable</code>, when I debug and inspect ""sel"", which in that case is the IEnumerable, it has some interesting members: ""inner"", ""outer"", ""innerKeySelector"" and ""outerKeySelector"", these last 2 appear to be delegates.

I presume that the two delegates determine which goes in and what goes out of it?</p></li>
<li><p>I noticed that if I use ""Distinct"", the ""inner"" contains 6 items (this is incorrect as only 2 are Distinct), but the ""outer"" does contain the correct values. Again, probably the delegated methods determine this but this is a bit more than I know about IEnumerable.</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, which of the two options is the best performance-wise?</p></li>

<p>Here are sample questions that I have not been able to solve:</p>

<li>How is the quote system managed? I made a <a href=""http://tinyperl.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">TinyPerl</a> script<br>
( <code>foreach $i (@ARGV) { print '*' . $i ; }</code> ), compiled it and called it this way :

<ul>
<li><code>my_script.exe ""a """"b"""" c""</code> → output is  <code>*a ""b*c</code></li>
<li><code>my_script.exe """"""a b c""""""</code> → output it <code>*""a*b*c""</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does the internal <code>echo</code> command work? What is expanded inside that command?</li>
<li>Why do I have to use <code>for [...] %%I</code> in file scripts, but <code>for [...] %I</code> in interactive sessions?</li>
<li>What are the escape characters, and in what context? How to escape a percent sign? For example, how can I echo <code>%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%</code> literally? I found that <code>echo.exe %""""PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%</code> works, is there a better solution?</li>
<li>How do pairs of <code>%</code> match? Example:

<ul>
<li><code>set b=a</code> , <code>echo %a %b% c%</code> → <code>%a a c%</code></li>
<li><code>set a =b</code>, <code>echo %a %b% c%</code> → <code>bb c%</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do I ensure a variable passes to a command as a single argument if ever this variable contains double quotes?</li>
<li>How are variables stored when using the <code>set</code> command? For example, if I do <code>set a=a"" b</code> and then <code>echo.%a%</code> I obtain <code>a"" b</code>. If I however use <code>echo.exe</code> from the UnxUtils, I get <code>a b</code>. How comes <code>%a%</code> expands in a different way?</li>

I have a many to many relationship, lets say between BlogPost and Tag entities. This means that in my T4 generated POCO BlogPost class I have:</p>

<pre><code>public virtual ICollection&lt;Tag&gt; Tags {
    // getter and setter with the magic FixupCollection
}
private ICollection&lt;Tag&gt; _tags;
</code></pre>

<p>I ask for a BlogPost and the related Tags from an instance of the ObjectContext and send it to another layer (View in the MVC application). Later I get back the updated BlogPost with changed properties and changed relationships. For example it had tags ""A"" ""B"" and ""C"", and the new tags are ""C"" and ""D"". In my particular example there are no new Tags and the properties of the Tags never change, so the only thing which should be saved is the changed relationships. Now I need to save this in another ObjectContext. (Update: Now I tried to do in the same context instance and also failed.)</p>

<p>The problem: I can't make it save the relationships properly. I tried everything I found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Controller.UpdateModel and Controller.TryUpdateModel don't work.</li>
<li>Getting the old BlogPost from the context then modifying the collection doesn't work. (with different methods from the next point)</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2291980/how-to-save-child-relationship-entities-in-the-entity-framework"">This</a> probably would work, but I hope this is just a workaround, not the solution :(.</li>
<li>Tried Attach/Add/ChangeObjectState functions for BlogPost and/or Tags in every possible combinations. Failed.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.codetuning.net/blog/post/Binding-Model-Graphs-with-ASPNETMVC.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> looks like what I need, but it doesn't work (I tried to fix it, but can't for my problem).</li>
<li>Tried ChangeState/Add/Attach/... the relationship objects of the context. Failed.</li>
</ul>

<p>""Doesn't work"" means in most cases that I worked on the given ""solution"" until it produces no errors and saves at least the properties of BlogPost. What happens with the relationships varies: usually Tags are added again to the Tag table with new PKs and the saved BlogPost references those and not the original ones. Of course the returned Tags have PKs, and before the save/update methods I check the PKs and they are equal to the ones in the database so probably EF thinks that they are new objects and those PKs are the temp ones.</p>

<p>A problem I know about and might make it impossible to find an automated simple solution: When a POCO object's collection is changed, that should happen by the above mentioned virtual collection property, because then the FixupCollection trick will update the reverse references on the other end of the many-to-many relationship. However when a View ""returns"" an updated BlogPost object, that didn't happen. This means that maybe there is no simple solution to my problem, but that would make me very sad and I would hate the EF4-POCO-MVC triumph :(. Also that would mean that EF can't do this in the MVC environment whichever EF4 object types are used :(. I think the snapshot based change tracking should find out that the changed BlogPost has relationships to Tags with existing PKs.</p>

<p>Btw: I think the same problem happens with one-to-many relations (google and my colleague say so). I will give it a try at home, but even if that works that doesn't help me in my six many-to-many relationships in my app :(.</p>

<p>As you can see I've set all the relevant padding to 0, but there is still padding around the Spinner. What have I done wrong or what do I need to do to get rid of the extra padding?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>
Some have questioned why I am trying to do this. </p>

<p>As per the Material Design specs, the spinner should be 72dp from the left side <img src=""https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/images/layout-metrics-keylines-keylines-spacing-mobile-02bb_large_mdpi.png"" alt=""desc""></p>

<p>I need to neutralize the padding Google have put there in order to properly place my spinner: <img src=""https://i.imgur.com/nBxY2gh.png"" alt=""desc""></p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>As per Chris Bane's answer below I set the contentInsetStart to 0. For the support library you will need to use the app namespace:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout
    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""
    android:layout_width=""match_parent""
    android:layout_height=""match_parent""&gt;

     &lt;android.support.v7.widget.Toolbar
        android:id=""@+id/toolbar""
        android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
        android:layout_width=""match_parent""
        android:minHeight=""@dimen/action_bar_height""
        android:background=""?attr/colorPrimary""

<p>A more complex case is when we want to offer more complex inputs.  For example, if we want to allow multiple filters on search:</p>

<pre><code>http://our.api.com/Search?term=pumas&amp;filters={""productType"":[""Clothing"",""Bags""],""color"":[""Black"",""Red""]}
</code></pre>

<p>We don't necessarily want to put the filter types (e.g. productType and color) as request names like this:</p>

<pre><code>http://our.api.com/Search?term=pumas&amp;productType=[""Clothing"",""Bags""]&amp;color=[""Black"",""Red""]
</code></pre>

<p>Because we wanted to group all filter input together.</p>

<p>In the end, does this really matter?  It may be likely that there are so many JSON utils out there that the input type just doesn't matter that much.</p>

<p>I know our JavaScript clients making AJAX calls to the API may appreciate the JSON inputs to make their life easier.</p>

<p>I'm trying to improve the maintainability of some code involving reflection. The app has a .NET Remoting interface exposing (among other things) a method called Execute for accessing parts of the app not included in its published remote interface. </p>

<p>Here is how the app designates properties (a static one in this example) which are meant to be accessible via Execute:</p>

<pre><code>RemoteMgr.ExposeProperty(""SomeSecret"", typeof(SomeClass), ""SomeProperty"");
</code></pre>

<p>So a remote user could call: </p>

<pre><code>string response = remoteObject.Execute(""SomeSecret"");
</code></pre>

<p>and the app would use reflection to find SomeClass.SomeProperty and return its value as a string.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if someone renames SomeProperty and forgets to change the 3rd parm of ExposeProperty(), it breaks this mechanism.</p>

<p>I need to the equivalent of: </p>

<pre><code>SomeClass.SomeProperty.GetTheNameOfThisPropertyAsAString()
</code></pre>

<p>to use as the 3rd parm in ExposeProperty so refactoring tools would take care of renames.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do this? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Okay, here's what I ended up creating (based upon the answer I selected and the question he referenced):</p>

<pre><code>// &lt;summary&gt;
// Get the name of a static or instance property from a property access lambda.
// &lt;/summary&gt;
// &lt;typeparam name=""T""&gt;Type of the property&lt;/typeparam&gt;
// &lt;param name=""propertyLambda""&gt;lambda expression of the form: '() =&gt; Class.Property' or '() =&gt; object.Property'&lt;/param&gt;
// &lt;returns&gt;The name of the property&lt;/returns&gt;
public string GetPropertyName&lt;T&gt;(Expression&lt;Func&lt;T&gt;&gt; propertyLambda)
{
    var me = propertyLambda.Body as MemberExpression;

    if (me == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException(""You must pass a lambda of the form: '() =&gt; Class.Property' or '() =&gt; object.Property'"");
    }

    return me.Member.Name;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>// Static Property
string name = GetPropertyName(() =&gt; SomeClass.SomeProperty);

// Instance Property
string name = GetPropertyName(() =&gt; someObject.SomeProperty);
</code></pre>

<p>Now with this cool capability, it's time to simplify the ExposeProperty method. Polishing doorknobs is dangerous work...</p>

<p>(Note, the ListView code was copied verbatim from the Android Views tutorial.  I haven't yet customized it to my needs, I'm just trying to figure out how to make this work.)</p>

<p>The basic layout is a LinearLayout, containing a ScrollView (called ""groupsScrollView"" in the code below), containing a RelativeLayout.  I have some buttons and text, and then my ListView beneath that, which displays the list of names.  All this is taller than the visible screen area, so the user is allowed to scroll vertically to see it all.</p>

<p>This all works beautifully, except when the page loads it is always pre-scrolled to the top of my ListView - in the middle of the page.  The text and buttons I've created that tell the user what to do are not visible.  </p>

<p>I can grab the screen and scroll up, that works just fine, but I'd like the screen to load having already been scrolled to the top.  The user shouldn't have to scroll UP to see the top of a freshly loaded page.  But everything I've tried to programmatically scroll to the top of the screen has failed.</p>

<p>Here's my onCreate method:</p>

<pre><code>protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {

    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    setContentView(R.layout.groups);

    mainScrollView = (ScrollView)findViewById(R.id.groupsScrollView);

    //get the Bundle out of the Intent...
    Bundle extras = getIntent().getExtras();
    mNames = extras.getStringArray(""mNames"");

    setListAdapter(new ArrayAdapter&lt;String&gt;(this, R.layout.list_item, mNames));

    ListView lv = getListView();
    lv.setTextFilterEnabled(true);

    //This is the line I'm having issues with
    mainScrollView.pageScroll(View.FOCUS_UP);

    lv.setOnItemClickListener(new OnItemClickListener() {
        public void onItemClick(AdapterView&lt;?&gt; parent, View view,
            int position, long id) {
          // When clicked, show a toast with the TextView text
          Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), ((TextView) view).getText(),
              Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
      });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The line ""mainScrollView.pageScroll(View.FOCUS_UP); is the problem.  It doesn't cause an error, but it doesn't seem to do anything.  I've tried scrollTo(0,0), scrollDirection(View.FOCUS_UP), and everything else I can think of.  </p>

<p>Since I don't get an error I have to assume that these scroll commands are actually working, but that they're scrolling to the top of the ListView, rather than the top of the ScrollView or RelativeLayout that contains it.  This seems to be confirmed by Google's own description of the scrollTo(int x, int y) method where they say ""This version also clamps the scrolling to the bounds of our child."".  </p>

<p>So to make a long question even longer, how do I load a bunch of views on the screen contained within a ScrollView, and then programmatically scroll the whole thing to the top of the page so the user can interact with it?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Used correctly, it can get close-ish to low-level languages. (A favorite thing for Haskellers to do is to try and get within 5% of C (or even beat it, but that means you are using an inefficient C program, since GHC compiles Haskell to C).) My question is, why?</p>

<p>Haskell is declarative and based on lambda calculus. Machine architectures are clearly imperative, being based on turing machines, roughly. Indeed, Haskell doesn't even have a specific evaluation order. Also, instead of dealing with machine data types, you make algebraic data types all the time.</p>

<p>Weirdest of all though is higher order functions. You would think that creating functions on the fly, and throwing them around, would make a program slower. <a href=""https://hbtvl.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/efficient-parsing-of-large-text-files-part-4-and-conclusion/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">But using higher order functions actually makes Haskell faster.</a> Indeed, it seems that, to optimize Haskell code, you need to make it more elegant and abstract instead of more machine-like. None of Haskell's more advanced features seem to even <em>affect</em> its performance, if they don't improve it.</p>

<p>Sorry if this is sounding ranty, but here is my question: <strong>Why is Haskell (compiled with GHC) so fast, considering its abstract nature and differences from physical machines?</strong></p>

<p>Note: The reason I say C and other imperative languages are somewhat similar to Turing Machines (but not to the extent that Haskell is similar to Lambda Calculus) is that in an imperative language, you have a finite number of states (a.k.a. line number), along with a Tape (the ram), such that the state and the current tape determine what to do to the tape. See the Wikipedia entry, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine_equivalents"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Turing machine equivalents</a>, for the transition from Turing Machines to computers.</p>

<p>We've had Analytics in our app for several months now, it's definitely tracking screen views, events, goals etc, the Tag Manager container is linked to the Analytics property, I'm sure I'm looking at the correct property and the container is published (for 3 days now).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Avt8.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Avt8.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>While inside the app I'm getting data for the different variations from the container, even after three days I still don't see any sessions in Analytics. It's really frustrating.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRLqQ.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VRLqQ.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Is there some secret sauce not mentioned in the above guide, or could there be some beginners mistake that comes to mind that I could be making? </p>

<p>Is there something I have to explicitly do from inside the app to make the sessions count? According to the guide, I linked above, there shouldn't be.</p>

<h2>Edit 1</h2>

<p>Since posting this, a few sessions have appeared for this content experiment (after 10 days!) in the Google Analytics Web interface, but so far only one variant, even though I have clearly determined via debugging that I am getting both variants returned by Tag Manager. </p>

<p>I only did one change since originally asking this question, and that's adding a (dummy) Google Analytics tag to the Tag Manager container we're using. I have no idea whether this triggered the sessions to start being picked up by Google Analytics or not, but it seems likely unless the GA/Tag Manager guys fixed something on their end. </p>

<p>Anyway, I'm still just tapping in the dark here as it seems that the official documentation for this feature has some major holes in it. Nowhere in the guide, I linked below does it mention that we have to create an Analytics tag in the container to make the connection between Tag Manager and Analytics work. In fact, it says there that the only thing necessary for linking them is to explicitly add an External Account Link to Analytics from Tag Manager in the settings of the service, which I did from the very beginning.</p>

<h2>Edit 2</h2>

<p>OK, it looks like the missing A variant was a false alarm, now there are a few sessions from both variants in the Analytics Content Experiment report.</p>

<p><strong>It's still very much unclear why it took over a week to get the first session in the report</strong>, even though I ran several sessions all throughout that week and none of them showed up <strong>until I added a dummy Google Analytics tag to our Google Tag Manager container.</strong> This tag is configured to track a dummy event, that the app actually never even tries to trigger, and it definitely doesn't show up in Google Analytics.</p>

<h2>Edit 3</h2>

<p>OK, 24 hours later I don't see any more sessions from yesterday, despite running the app periodically on a few devices yesterday to make sure I can see something new today. What's worse, when defining the experiment in Tag Manager, I selected a Goal from Analytics as the test goal, and the Content Experiment shows 0 conversions for it in both variants' sessions despite the fact that under <strong>Conversions->Goals->Overview</strong> I see 8 conversions for that same day. I'm sure all of those conversions were done by me because this Google Analytics property is only used for testing, it's not live.</p>

I want to shuffle each of them, such that corresponding elements continue to correspond -- i.e. shuffle them in unison with respect to their leading indices.</p>

<p>This code works, and illustrates my goals:</p>

<pre><code>def shuffle_in_unison(a, b):
    assert len(a) == len(b)
    shuffled_a = numpy.empty(a.shape, dtype=a.dtype)
    shuffled_b = numpy.empty(b.shape, dtype=b.dtype)
    permutation = numpy.random.permutation(len(a))
    for old_index, new_index in enumerate(permutation):
        shuffled_a[new_index] = a[old_index]
        shuffled_b[new_index] = b[old_index]
    return shuffled_a, shuffled_b
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = numpy.asarray([[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = numpy.asarray([1, 2, 3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; shuffle_in_unison(a, b)
(array([[2, 2],
       [1, 1],
       [3, 3]]), array([2, 1, 3]))
</code></pre>

<p>However, this feels clunky, inefficient, and slow, and it requires making a copy of the arrays -- I'd rather shuffle them in-place, since they'll be quite large.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to go about this? Faster execution and lower memory usage are my primary goals, but elegant code would be nice, too.</p>

<p>One other thought I had was this:</p>

<pre><code>def shuffle_in_unison_scary(a, b):
    rng_state = numpy.random.get_state()
    numpy.random.shuffle(a)
    numpy.random.set_state(rng_state)
    numpy.random.shuffle(b)
</code></pre>

<p>This works...but it's a little scary, as I see little guarantee it'll continue to work -- it doesn't look like the sort of thing that's guaranteed to survive across numpy version, for example.</p>

The problem with this is that I don't always want to use translations (eg. for the second controller I just want to pass a raw string).</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>Is this a known issue / limitation? How can this be solved?</p>

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6111565/now-that-we-have-stdarray-what-uses-are-left-for-c-style-arrays"">This question</a> discusses the uses left for a C array like <code>int arr[20];</code>. On <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6111565/now-that-we-have-stdarray-what-uses-are-left-for-c-style-arrays/6113104#6113104"">his answer</a>, @James Kanze shows one of the last strongholds of C arrays, it's unique initialization characteristics:</p>

<pre><code>int arr[] = { 1, 3, 3, 7, 0, 4, 2, 0, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9 };
</code></pre>

<p>We don't have to specify the number of elements, hooray! Now iterate over it with the C++11 functions <code>std::begin</code> and <code>std::end</code> from <code>&lt;iterator&gt;</code> (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5897319/how-to-use-stdsort-to-sort-a-array-in-c/5897358#5897358"">or your own variants</a>) and you never need to even think of its size.</p>

<p>Now, are there any (possibly TMP) ways to achieve the same with <code>std::array</code>? Use of macros allowed to make it look nicer. :)</p>

<pre><code>??? std_array = { ""here"", ""be"", ""elements"" };
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Intermediate version, compiled from various answers, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;array&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

template&lt;class T, class... Tail, class Elem = typename std::decay&lt;T&gt;::type&gt;
std::array&lt;Elem,1+sizeof...(Tail)&gt; make_array(T&amp;&amp; head, Tail&amp;&amp;... values)
{
  return { std::forward&lt;T&gt;(head), std::forward&lt;Tail&gt;(values)... };
}

// in code
auto std_array = make_array(1,2,3,4,5);
</code></pre>

<p>And employs all kind of cool C++11 stuff:</p>

<ul>
<li>Variadic Templates</li>
<li><code>sizeof...</code></li>
<li>rvalue references</li>
<li>perfect forwarding</li>
<li><code>std::array</code>, of course</li>
<li>uniform initialization</li>
<li>omitting the return type with uniform initialization</li>
<li>type inference (<code>auto</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>And an example can be found <a href=""http://ideone.com/fsfT0"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, as @Johannes points out in the comment on @Xaade's answer, you can't initialize nested types with such a function. Example:</p>

<pre><code>struct A{ int a; int b; };

// C syntax
A arr[] = { {1,2}, {3,4} };
// using std::array
??? std_array = { {1,2}, {3,4} };
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the number of initializers is limited to the number of function and template arguments supported by the implementation.</p>

<p>EDIT: The current accepted answer has done exactly what I've wanted to do. I recommend it for easy usage for getting the time between two dates in the form that that PHP <code>time()</code> function uses. If you aren't particularly familiar with PHP, that's the time in seconds from January 1st, 1970. This is beneficial for a backend in PHP. If perhaps you're using a backend like NodeJS you might want to consider some of the other options you'll find below.</p>

Here's what the <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html#Transactions"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs</a> say:</p>

  <p><strong>BadImageFormatException was unhandled</strong>:<br>
  Could not load file or assembly 'ProjectA, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both are just regular projects, with no dependencies on any other non-.Net projects.  Both are fully .Net - there is no native code, and no P/Invoke.  I have other projects which depend on <code>ProjectA</code> and still work just fine.</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure both projects are set to ""Any CPU,"" with the <em>build</em> checkbox checked.  They are.</li>
<li>Make sure both projects are for the same Target Framework <em>(.Net 4.0 Client Profile)</em>.</li>
<li>Under ProjectB --> References --> ProjectA --> Properties, make sure <em>""Copy Local""</em> is set to <em>""True""</em> _ <em>(I verified that ProjectA.dll is being copied correctly)</em></li>
<li>Clean/Rebuild the solution.  I even tried manually deleting the /bin and /obj folders in both projects.</li>
<li>Restart Visual Studio.  Restart my computer.</li>
<li>Check out an entirely new copy of the repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I still get the same error.  I have no idea what I did to cause this, nor how to fix it.  Any ideas?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during transport.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is it not that data is always stored/transmitted in binary because the memory that our machines have store binary and it just depends how you interpret it? So, whether you encode the bit pattern <code>010011010110000101101110</code> as <code>Man</code> in ASCII or as <code>TWFu</code> in Base64, you are eventually going to store the same bit pattern.</p>

<p><strong>If the ultimate encoding is in terms of zeros and ones and every machine and media can deal with them, how does it matter if the data is represented as ASCII or Base64?</strong></p>

<p>What does it mean ""media that are designed to deal with textual data""? They can deal with binary => they can deal with anything.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks everyone, I think I understand now.</p>

<p>When we send over data, we cannot be sure that the data would be interpreted in the same format as we intended it to be. So, we send over data coded in some format (like Base64) that both parties understand. That way even if sender and receiver interpret same things differently, but because they agree on the coded format, the data will not get interpreted wrongly.</p>

<p>From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538021/why-do-we-use-base64/3538079#3538079"">Mark Byers example</a></p>

<p>If I want to send </p>

<pre><code>Hello
world!
</code></pre>

<p>One way is to send it in ASCII like </p>

<pre><code>72 101 108 108 111 10 119 111 114 108 100 33
</code></pre>

<p>But byte 10 might not be interpreted correctly as a newline at the other end. So, we use a subset of ASCII to encode it like this</p>

<pre><code>83 71 86 115 98 71 56 115 67 110 100 118 99 109 120 107 73 61 61
</code></pre>

<p>which at the cost of more data transferred for the same amount of information ensures that the receiver can decode the data in the intended way, even if the receiver happens to have different interpretations for the rest of the character set.</p>

<p>When there are 4 or more items I want the <code>ScrollView</code> to stop expanding (thus a <code>maxHeight</code>) and start providing scrolling.</p>

<p>However, there is unfortunately no way to set a <code>maxHeight</code>. So I probably have to set my <code>ScrollView</code> height programmatically to either <code>WRAP_CONTENT</code> when there are 1..3 items and set the height to <code>3*sizeOf(View)</code> when there are 4 or more items.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain why there is no <code>maxHeight</code> provided, when there is already a <code>minHeight</code>? </p>

<p>Here is my question:</p>

<p>What is a good way to assign colors to categorical variables in ggplot2 that have stable mapping? I need consistent colors across a set of graphs that have different subsets and different number of categorical variables. </p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>plot1 &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(xData, yData,color=categoricaldData)) + geom_line()
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>categoricalData</code> has 5 levels.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>where <code>categoricalData.subset</code> has 3 levels.</p>

<p>However, a particular level that is in both sets will end up with a different color, which makes it harder to read the graphs together.</p>

<p>Do I need to create a vector of colors in the data frame? Or is there another way to assigns specific colors to categories?</p>

<p>But it's not. I was surprised when this code compiled on Visual Studio, but I have learnt not to trust MSVC compiler as far as C++ rules are concerned, so I checked the standard and it <strong><em>is</em></strong> allowed by the standard as well. You can see 8.5.1 for the grammar rules if you don't believe me.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kru1Y.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Why is this allowed? This may be a stupid useless question but I want you to understand why I am asking. If it were a sub-case of a general grammar rule, I would understand - they decided not to make the general grammar any more difficult just to disallow a redundant comma at the end of an initializer list. But no, the additional comma is <strong><em>explicitly</em></strong> allowed. For example, it isn't allowed to have a redundant comma in the end of a function-call argument list (when the function takes <code>...</code>), <em>which is normal</em>.</p>

<p>So, again, is there any particular reason this redundant comma is <strong><em>explicitly</em></strong> allowed?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if foo #10 is deleted from the data set before the API consumer makes the next query, /foos?page=2 will offset by 100 and return foos #102-201.</p>

<p>After getting bootstrap and its dependencies with npm, our first approach consisted in adding them in <code>angular-cli-build.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  'bootstrap/dist/**/*.min.+(js|css)',  
  'jquery/dist/jquery.min.+(js|map)',  
  'tether/dist/**/*.min.+(js|css)',

<p><strong>How we are intended to handle such scenario (i.e. loading bootstrap scripts) in a project generated with angular-cli ?</strong></p>

<p>We had the following thoughts but we don't really know which way to go...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>use a CDN ? but we would rather serve these files to guarantee that they will be available</p></li>
<li><p>copy dependencies to <code>dist/vendor</code> after our <code>ng build -prod</code> ? But that seems like something angular-cli should provide since it 'takes care' of the build part ?</p></li>
<li><p>adding jquery, bootstrap and tether in src/system-config.ts and somehow pull them into our bundle in main.ts ? But that seemed wrong considering that we are not going to explicitly use them in our application's code (unlike moment.js or something like lodash, for example)</p></li>

This only happens inside the virtualenv.  If I open a console outside the virtualenv then pkg_resources is present</p>

To add to confusion, when I test the page at <a href=""https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/</a> it tells me to ""Leverage browser caching"".</p>

This works as expected if I use:</p>

<pre><code>AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);

<p>However, I am leery of using ""this"" as a context due to the potential for memory leaks when Activity is destroyed and recreated even during something simple like a screen rotation. From a <a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/01/avoiding-memory-leaks.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">related post on the Android developer's blog</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two easy ways to avoid context-related memory leaks. The most obvious one is to avoid escaping the context outside of its own scope. The example above showed the case of a static reference but inner classes and their implicit reference to the outer class can be equally dangerous. The second solution is to use the Application context. This context will live as long as your application is alive and does not depend on the activities life cycle. If you plan on keeping long-lived objects that need a context, remember the application object. You can obtain it easily by calling Context.getApplicationContext() or Activity.getApplication().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But for the <code>AlertDialog()</code> neither <code>getApplicationContext()</code> or <code>getApplication()</code> is acceptable as a Context, as it throws the exception: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Unable to add window — token null is not for an application”</p>

<p>I understand there are many legacy problems for core Perl scripts, where it may break things. But, from my point of view, in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, big new projects (or projects with a big perspective) should make their software UTF-8 proof from scratch. Still I don't see it happening. For example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose_%28Perl%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Moose</a> enables strict and warnings, but not <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode"" rel=""noreferrer"">Unicode</a>. <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~chromatic/Modern-Perl-1.03/lib/Modern/Perl.pm"" rel=""noreferrer"">Modern::Perl</a> reduces boilerplate too, but no UTF-8 handling.</p>

<p>Why? Are there some reasons to avoid UTF-8 in modern Perl projects in the year 2011?</p>

<hr>

<p>Commenting @tchrist got too long, so I'm adding it here.</p>

<p>It seems that I did not make myself clear. Let me try to add some things.</p>

<p><strong>tchrist</strong> and I see situation pretty similarly, but our conclusions are completely in opposite ends. I agree, the situation with Unicode is complicated, but this is why we (Perl users and coders) need some layer (or pragma) which makes UTF-8 handling as easy as it must be nowadays.</p>

<p><strong>tchrist</strong> pointed to many aspects to cover, I will read and think about them for days or even weeks. Still, this is not my point. <strong>tchrist</strong> tries to prove that there is not one single way ""to enable UTF-8"". I have not so much knowledge to argue with that. So, I stick to live examples.</p>

<p>I played around with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakudo_Perl"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rakudo</a> and UTF-8 was just there <strong>as I needed</strong>. I didn't have any problems, it just worked. Maybe there are some limitation somewhere deeper, but at start, all I tested worked as I expected.</p>

<p>Shouldn't that be a goal in modern Perl&nbsp;5 too? I stress it more: I'm not suggesting UTF-8 as the default character set for core Perl, I suggest the possibility to trigger it <strong>with a snap</strong> for those who develop <strong>new</strong> projects.</p>

<p>Another example, but with a more negative tone. Frameworks should make development easier. Some years ago, I tried web frameworks, but just threw them away because ""enabling UTF-8"" was so obscure. I did not find how and where to hook Unicode support. It was so time-consuming that I found it easier to go the old way. Now I saw here there was a bounty to deal with the same problem with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_%28Perl%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mason</a> 2: <em><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5858596/how-to-make-mason2-utf8-clean"">How to make Mason2 UTF-8 clean?</a></em>. So, it is pretty new framework, but using it with UTF-8 needs deep knowledge of its internals. It is like a big red sign: STOP, don't use me!</p>

<p>I really like Perl. But dealing with Unicode is painful. I still find myself running against walls. Some way <strong>tchrist</strong> is right and answers my questions: new projects don't attract UTF-8 because it is too complicated in Perl&nbsp;5.</p>

I haven't been able to understand quite well (theoretically) about the differences between them, and why I should ""push"" to a bare repository. Here's the deal:</p>

<p>Currently, I'm the only one working on a project on 3 different computers, but there will be more people involved in it later, so I'm using Git for the version control. I clone the bare repo on all computers, and when I finish my modifications on one of them, I commit and push the changes to the bare repo. From what I've read, the bare repository does NOT have a ""working tree"", so if I clone the bare repo, I won't have a ""working tree"".</p>

<p>I'm guessing that the working tree stores the commit information, branches, etc. from the project. That wouldn't appear in the bare repo. So it seems better for me to ""push"" the commits to the repo with the working tree.</p>

<p>Then, <strong>why should I use the bare repository and why not? What's the practical difference?</strong> That would not be beneficial to more people working on a project, I suppose.</p>

{
    content: url(images/[someimage].png);
    position: absolute;
    left:-20px;
    top: -20px;

<p>and I find that this works fine:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""[url]"" class=""container""&gt;
  &lt;span class=""overlay""/&gt;
  &lt;img width=""200"" src=""[url]""/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but this does not:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""[url]"" class=""container""&gt;
  &lt;img width=""200"" src=""[url]"" class=""overlay""/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can use a <code>div</code> or <code>p</code> element instead of that <code>span</code>, and the browser correctly overlays my image over the image in the <code>img</code> element, but if I apply the overlay class to the <code>img</code> itself, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>I'd like to get this working because that extra <code>span</code> offends me, but more importantly, I've got about 100 blog posts that I'd like to modify, and I can do this in one go if I could just modify the stylesheet, but if I have to go back and add an extra <code>span</code> element in between the <code>a</code> and <code>img</code> elements, this will be a lot more work.  </p>

</code></pre>

<p>What I want to figure out is - </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I see in logs that when pressing ""go to feed"" <code>renderScene</code> is called several times though the view renders correctly once. Is it how the animation works?</p>

<pre><code>index.ios.js:57 Object {name: 'WelcomeView', component: function}
index.ios.js:57 Object {name: 'FeedView', component: function}
// renders Feed View
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Generally does my approach conforms the React way, or it can be done better? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What I want to achieve is something similar to <a href=""http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigatorios.html#content"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>NavigatorIOS</code></a> but without navigation bar (however some views will have their own custom navigation bar).</p>

The intermediate repository has it's master branch rebased nightly from the upstream SVN, and we are working on feature branches. For example:</p>

<pre><code>remote:
  master

local:
  master
  feature
</code></pre>

<p>I can successfully push my feature branch back to the remote, and end up with what I expect:</p>

<pre><code>remote:
  master
  feature

local:
  master
  feature
</code></pre>

<p>I then re-setup the branch to track the remote:</p>

<pre><code>remote:
  master
  feature

local:
  master
  feature -&gt; origin/feature
</code></pre>

<p>And all is well. What I would like to do from here is to rebase the feature branch to the master branch on the remote, but I would like to do this from my local machine. I'd like to be able to do:</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull
git checkout feature
git rebase master
git push origin feature
</code></pre>

<p>To keep the remote feature branch up-to-date with the remote master. However, this method causes Git to complain:</p>

<pre><code>To &lt;remote&gt;
 ! [rejected]        feature -&gt; feature (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '&lt;remote&gt;'
To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
</code></pre>

<p><code>git pull</code> does the trick but causes a merge commit that I'd like to avoid. I'm concerned that the message states <code>feature -&gt; feature</code> rather than <code>feature -&gt; origin/feature</code> but this may just be a presentation thing. </p>

<p>Am I missing something, or going about this in completely the wrong way? It's not critical to avoid doing the rebase on the remote server, but it makes fixing any merge conflicts from the rebase much harder.</p>

<p>I currently have <a href=""http://www.haselden.co.uk/rttest/index.html"">this site</a> with a body <code>font-size</code> of 100%. 100% of what though? This seems to compute out at 16px. </p>

<p>I was under the impression that 100% would somehow refer to the size of the browser window, but apparently not because it's always 16px whether the window is resized down to a mobile width or full blown widescreen desktop.</p>

<p>How can I make the text on my site scale in relation to its container? I tried using <code>em</code> but this doesn't scale either.</p>

<p>My reasoning is that things like my menu become squished when you resize, so I need to reduce the px <code>font-size</code> of <code>.menuItem</code> among other elements in relation to the width of the container. (E.g in the menu on a large desktop, 22px works perfectly. Move down to tablet width and 16px is more appropriate.)</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong><br>
I know in <strong>some</strong> browsers you can <strong>sometimes</strong> (almost always) drop files into the file input itself. I know Chrome usually does this, but sometimes it fails and then loads the file in the current page (a big fail if you're filling out a form). I want to fool- &amp; browserproof it.</p>

Response might be a JSON string or it might be a file (as an attachment). I can easily detect Content-Type and Content-Disposition in my ajax call, but once I detect that the response contains a file, how do I offer the client to download it? I've read a number of similar threads here but none of them provide the answer I'm looking for. </p>

<p>Please, please, please do not post answers suggesting that I shouldn't use ajax for this or that I should redirect the browser, because none of this is an option.

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Apparently, this cannot be done, but there is a simple workaround, as suggested by the accepted answer. For anyone who comes across this issue in the future, here's how I solved it:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: ""POST"",

        var disp = request.getResponseHeader('Content-Disposition');

            var form = $('&lt;form method=""POST"" action=""' + url + '""&gt;');
            $.each(params, function(k, v) {
                form.append($('&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""' + k +
                        '"" value=""' + v + '""&gt;'));
            });
            $('body').append(form);
            form.submit();
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, just generate a HTML form with the same params that were used in AJAX request and submit it. </p>

Or is this answer correct that it <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18908175/retrofit-body-showing-up-as-parameter-in-http-request?rq=1"">must be form url encoded and passed as a field</a>?

<p>I just want to clarify this with the <em>restperts</em> once and for all.  One person answered not to use Retrofit. The other was not certain of the syntax. Another thinks yes it can be done but only if its form url-encoded and placed in a field (that's not acceptable in my case).  No, I can't re-code all the services for my Android client. And yes, it's very common in major projects to post raw JSON instead of passing over JSON content as field property values.  Let's get it right and move on. Can someone point to the documentation or example that shows how this is done? Or provide a valid reason why it can/should not be done.</p>

<p>However, <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/339-chef-solo-basics?view=asciicast"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Railscast 339: Chef Solo Basics</a> uses <code>scp</code> to copy in the opposite direction (from the remote server to the local machine):</p>

<p>Why use the <code>rsync</code> command if <code>scp</code> will copy in both directions? How does <code>scp</code> differ from <code>rsync</code>?</p>

I like it when it's right, because it gives me good code-completion and parameter info, and it gives me warnings if I try to access an attribute that doesn't exist.</p>

<p>But when it comes to parameters, it knows nothing. The code-completion dropdowns can't show anything, because they don't know what type the parameter will be. The code analysis can't look for warnings.</p>

<pre><code>class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

peasant = Person(""Dennis"", 37)
# PyCharm knows that the ""peasant"" variable is of type Person
peasant.dig_filth()   # shows warning -- Person doesn't have a dig_filth method

class King:
    def repress(self, peasant):
        # PyCharm has no idea what type the ""peasant"" parameter should be
        peasant.knock_over()   # no warning even though knock_over doesn't exist

King().repress(peasant)
# Even if I call the method once with a Person instance, PyCharm doesn't
# consider that to mean that the ""peasant"" parameter should always be a Person
</code></pre>

<p>This makes a certain amount of sense. Other call sites could pass anything for that parameter. But if my method expects a parameter to be of type, say, <code>pygame.Surface</code>, I'd like to be able to indicate that to PyCharm somehow, so it can show me all of <code>Surface</code>'s attributes in its code-completion dropdown, and highlight warnings if I call the wrong method, and so on.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can give PyCharm a  hint, and say ""psst, this parameter is supposed to be of type X""? (Or perhaps, in the spirit of dynamic languages, ""this parameter is supposed to quack like an X""? I'd be fine with that.)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> CrazyCoder's answer, below, does the trick. For any newcomers like me who want the quick summary, here it is:</p>

<pre><code>class King:
    def repress(self, peasant):
        """"""
        Exploit the workers by hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which
        perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.

        @type peasant: Person
        @param peasant: Person to repress.
        """"""
        peasant.knock_over()   # Shows a warning. And there was much rejoicing.
</code></pre>

<p>The relevant part is the <code>@type peasant: Person</code> line of the docstring.</p>

<p>If you also go to File > Settings > Python Integrated Tools and set ""Docstring format"" to ""Epytext"", then PyCharm's View > Quick Documentation Lookup will pretty-print the parameter information instead of just printing all the @-lines as-is.</p>

<p>I implemented the <code>UIApplicationDelegete</code> method <code>application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler</code> and I send the following silent push</p>

<pre><code>{  
  ""aps"": {  
    ""content-available"": 1  
  },  
  ""mydata"": {  
    ""foo"": ""bar""  
  }  
} 
</code></pre>

<p>but the delegate method is not called on iOS 11. </p>

<p>It works fine on other versions of iOS and the documentation section <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CreatingtheNotificationPayload.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008194-CH10-SW8"" rel=""noreferrer"">Configuring a Silent Notification</a> does not mention that anything else should be done.</p>

<p>Is this a bug in iOS 11 or did I miss something new in iOS 11? </p>

<p>Please note that I'm not talking about or using the <code>UserNotification</code> framework which should not be needed for sending silent pushes.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/qdk3dh9irpsmbgi/PushBug11.zip?dl=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">sample project</a> that illustrates the issue (you'll have to set your own bundle id)</p>

<p>When you lunch the sample project and send a above payload to the app, you can use the macOS console to see that the push is correctly delivered to the device but not to the app.</p>

<h1>UPDATE 10.08</h1>

<p>It appears that the behaviour is random. Sometimes after restarting the device, the payload is delivered correctly but it stops working after a while.</p>

<p>As you can see on the following screenshot, the push marked as 1 is delievered only to the device and the push 2 (after device restart) is also delivered to the app.</p>

<h1>UPDATE 14.08 - iOS 11 Beta 6</h1>

<p>Still the same behaviour. Another thing that is supposed to work but does not is the following. When the application's scheme is set to ""Wait for executable to be launched"", a silent push is supposed to wake up the app and start it in background. </p>

<h1>UPDATE 21.08 - iOS 11 Beta 7</h1>

<p>Still the same behaviour and not updates from Apple in the bug report.</p>

<h1>UPDATE 29.08 - iOS 11 Beta 8</h1>

<p>Still the same problem. The steps to reproduce I use now are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Xcode project scheme, select ""Wait for executable to be launched""</li>
<li>Add a breakpoint in the <code>didReceiveRemoteNotification: fetchCompletionHandler</code></li>
<li>Start the app on device</li>
<li>Send the above silent push</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Expected</strong>: The app is brought from suspended state to background and the <code>didReceiveRemoteNotification: fetchCompletionHandler</code> is called</p>

<p><strong>Actual</strong>: nothing happens </p>

<h1>UPDATE 06.09 - iOS 11 Beta 10</h1>

<p>I'm still having the same buggy behaviour. The ticket from Apple was updated with the following answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple Developer Relations September 6 2017, 10:42 PM Engineering has
  provided the following feedback regarding this issue: </p>
  
  <p>We were able to get the sample app running and test the behavior. We
  didn’t see any issues when we tested this as described. </p>
  
  <p>Pushes aren't guaranteed to arrive to the app when it is running in
  the background, and the logs here indicate we don't believe the app is
  being used enough to launch it. </p>
  
  <p>We do see us delivering pushes from time to time when conditions are
  good. </p>
  
  <p>We believe this is behaving correctly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Update 11.09</h1>

<p>My Apple bug report was closed and marked as duplicate of <code>33278611</code> which remains open</p>

<h1>UPDATE 13.09 - iOS 11 GM</h1>

<p>Thanks to kam800's comments (see below) I did more testing and came up with those observations:</p>

<p>There seem to be a new daemon in iOS 11 <code>dasd   DuetActivitySchedulerDaemon</code> that either completely discards the data push or delays the data push delivery:</p>

<h3>Delivery postponed</h3>

<p><strong>Console Logs</strong></p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>Postponed delivery issues</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When the data push delivery is postponed and the app is launched, the data push is delivered only when the delivery date is reached which can be <em>several minutes</em> in the future. This defeats completely the purpose of using data pushes to keep the new app's content ready for the next launch. I quote here once again Apple's documentation: </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Silent notifications improve the user experience by helping you keep
  your app up-to-date, even when it is not running.""</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>When <strong>two</strong> data pushes are sent to a suspended app they are postponed by iOS 11 instead of waking up the app directly. When delivery time is reached, <em>only the last</em> data push is delivered! The previous pushes are lost and not delivered via the delegate method resulting in a data loss.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery cancelled</h3>

<p><strong>Console Logs</strong></p>

<pre><code>default 13:35:05.347078 +0200   dasd    DuetActivitySchedulerDaemon com.apple.pushLaunch.net.tequilaapps.daylight:C03A65:[

 ], FinalDecision: Must Not Proceed}    scoring com.apple.duetactivityscheduler
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Cancelled delivery issues</strong></p>

<p>Well in this case, the data push is completely lost and never delivered on iOS 11 while it was delivered correctly on iOS 10.</p>

<h1>UPDATE 19.09 - iOS 11 GM</h1>

<p>I also noticed that when the application is in the foreground and the notification is not delivered to the app, I see the following logs in the console:</p>

SDK: jdk1.6.0_21<br>
OS: Windows 7</p>

<p>So I have a strange situation with IntelliJ that has me completely stumped.  I setup a Maven project and add log4j as a dependency in the pom.xml file.  The IDEA inspections run fine and my unit tests all compile and run.</p>

<p>I then added hunnysoft's jmime library to my local maven repository using the mvn install:install-file as follows.</p>

<pre><code>mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jmime.jar -DgroupId=jmime \
-DartifactId=jmime -Dversion=3.1.1e -Dpackaging=jar
</code></pre>

<p>Maven installed the jar file just fine into my local repository.</p>

<p>I then went into IntelliJ's Settings => Maven => Repository Services and Updated my local repository (so that IntelliJ would reindex the repository contents).</p>

<p>Finally, I added the following dependency to my pom.xml file (just above the log4j dependency).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;jmime&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jmime&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.1.1e&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I now create a new class as follows:</p>

<pre><code>package com.stackoverflow.question;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.ByteString;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.Field;
import com.hunnysoft.jmime.FieldBody;

public class StackOverflowQuestion {
    public Field create(String name, String text) {
        Logger.getLogger(getClass()).debug(""create entered"");
        FieldBody body = new FieldBody();
        body.setText(new ByteString(text));
        Field field = new Field();
        field.setFieldName(name);
        field.setFieldBody(body);
        return field;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now for the weirdness.  IntelliJ's intention mechanism picks up and recognizes the Logger import in the maven pom file just fine.  However, for all of the hunnysoft imports it reports: ""Cannot resolve symbol 'ByteString/Field/FieldBody'"", <em>BUT</em> Build => Compile 'StackOverflowQuestion.java' compiles everything correctly and the unit test I created for this class runs fine (though the intentions mark the call to create() as a problem area too).</p>

<p>So somewhere, somehow IntelliJ is ignoring the jmime.jar file for the intention subsystem.  I'm confused because the log4j dependency works fine and everything compiles and runs fine.  F12 (""Go To Declaration"") works on the Logger import, but breaks on all the jmime imports.</p>

<p>Oh, one other thing, if I go to the 'Packages' view in the ""Projects"" window the ""com.hunnysoft.jmime"" package appears and I can see ALL of the classes I imported in the code snippet above under ""Libraries"".  Removing the above dependency from the pom.xml file causes this package to disappear and the compilation breaks.</p>

<p>It appears that the inspection's classpath is broken, but there does not seem to be a setting for this anywhere in the Settings => Intentions | Compiler areas (not that I expected any such settings, I believe the IDEA should already know the correct classpath based on the pom file and JDK).</p>

<p>As a final experiment I created a brand new standard J2SE application project (without using maven) and added the jmime.jar file directly to the project as one of its libraries.  I run into exactly the same problems as described above in this new project.</p>

<p>Here is the MANIFEST.MF from the jmime jar file.</p>

<pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0
Ant-Version: Apache Ant 1.5.4
Created-By: 10.0-b23 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)

Name: com/hunnysoft/jmime/

Implementation-Title: com.hunnysoft.jmime
Implementation-Version: 3.1.1E
Implementation-Vendor: Hunny Software, Inc.
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see anything unusual in this jar file.</p>

<p>My best guess is that perhaps the problem might be a missing dependency issue.  But AFAIK jmime is supposed to be self contained (JarAnalyzer doesn't come up with anything, but I'm not sure it would if a dependency jar is missing).</p>

<p>So, anyone have any IDEAs?</p>

<pre><code>...

<p>They then build an image from this Dockerfile:</p>

But incidentally I've got a request which have many attachments in it, I design a <code>Step2View</code> e.g. which user can upload documents in it asynchronously ,

    }

}

<p>This code leads to the following result: After the EditText has lost focus, the focus jumps back to EditText, but I can't edit the text anymore.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Changed my code. Scenario:</p>

<p>I click on the first EditText and put a String in it, which is already in the database. The toast is showing. Now I can't edit my String anymore. I click ""next"" on the keyboard and the focus stays on the first EditText. I try to edit my String, but nothing happens. Instead my new String is showing in the second EditText. I click on the back-arrow of my device and reclick on the first and second EditText --> no keyboard is showing.</p>

<p>Here is my new Code:</p>

<pre><code>public class CreateTableActivity extends Activity implements

    Mannschaftsanzahl.setOnFocusChangeListener(this);

    final Button save_button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.create_tabelle_speichern_button);

<p>I'm looking for something that would allow me to just <code>apt-get install foo</code> or <code>yum install foo</code> and then just works out-of-the-box, no wrappers or other adaptation necessary.</p>

<p>Here are some examples of things that come close:</p>

<p>Nokogiri. If I write this wrapper I could call the wrapper in the way described above:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby

require 'nokogiri'

Nokogiri::XML(STDIN).xpath(ARGV[0]).each do |row|
  puts row
end
</code></pre>

<p>XML::XPath. Would work with this wrapper:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use XML::XPath;

my $root = XML::XPath-&gt;new(ioref =&gt; 'STDIN');
for my $node ($root-&gt;find($ARGV[0])-&gt;get_nodelist) {
  print($node-&gt;getData, ""\n"");
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>xpath</code> from XML::XPath returns too much noise, <code>-- NODE --</code> and <code>attribute = ""value""</code>.</p>

<p><code>xml_grep</code> from XML::Twig cannot handle expressions that do not return elements, so cannot be used to extract attribute values without further processing.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p><code>echo cat //element/@attribute | xmllint --shell filename.xml</code> returns noise similar to <code>xpath</code>.</p>

<p><code>xmllint --xpath //element/@attribute filename.xml</code> returns <code>attribute = ""value""</code>.</p>

<p><code>xmllint --xpath 'string(//element/@attribute)' filename.xml</code> returns what I want, but only for the first match.</p>

<p>For another solution almost satisfying the question, here is an XSLT that can be used to evaluate arbitrary XPath expressions (requires dyn:evaluate support in the XSLT processor):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"" version=""1.0""

    &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt; 
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

<p>One way to do this would be to actually change the RestTemplate source code and add some extra logging statements there, but I would find this approach really a last resort thing. There should be some way to tell Spring Web Client/RestTemplate to log everything in a much friendlier way.</p>

<p>My goal would be to be able to do this with code like :</p>

<pre><code>restTemplate.put(""http://someurl"", objectToPut, urlPathValues);

<p>and then to get the same type of debug information (as I get with curl) in the log file or in the console.
I believe this would be extremely useful for anyone that uses the Spring RestTemplate and has problems. Using curl to debug your RestTemplate problems just doesn't work (in some cases). </p>

I am following the blog written <a href=""http://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/</a> for the Keras tutorial. What I am mainly confused about is, </p>

<ol>
<li>The reshaping of the data series into <code>[samples, time steps, features]</code> and,</li>
<li>The stateful LSTMs </li>
</ol>

<p>Lets concentrate on the above two questions with reference to the code pasted below:</p>

<pre><code># reshape into X=t and Y=t+1
look_back = 3
trainX, trainY = create_dataset(train, look_back)
testX, testY = create_dataset(test, look_back)

# reshape input to be [samples, time steps, features]
trainX = numpy.reshape(trainX, (trainX.shape[0], look_back, 1))
testX = numpy.reshape(testX, (testX.shape[0], look_back, 1))
########################
# The IMPORTANT BIT
##########################
# create and fit the LSTM network
batch_size = 1
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(4, batch_input_shape=(batch_size, look_back, 1), stateful=True))
model.add(Dense(1))
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')
for i in range(100):
    model.fit(trainX, trainY, nb_epoch=1, batch_size=batch_size, verbose=2, shuffle=False)
    model.reset_states()
</code></pre>

<p>Note: create_dataset takes a sequence of length N and returns a <code>N-look_back</code> array of which each element is a <code>look_back</code> length sequence.    </p>

<h1>What is Time Steps and Features?</h1>

<p>As can be seen TrainX is a 3-D array with Time_steps and Feature being the last two dimensions respectively (3 and 1 in this particular code). With respect to the image below, does this mean that we are considering the <code>many to one</code> case, where the number of pink boxes are 3? Or does it literally mean the chain length is 3 (i.e. only 3 green boxes considered). <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwhAP.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kwhAP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Does the features argument become relevant when we consider multivariate series? e.g. modelling two financial stocks simultaneously? </p>

<h1>Stateful LSTMs</h1>

<p>Does stateful LSTMs mean that we save the cell memory values between runs of batches? If this is the case, <code>batch_size</code> is one, and the memory is reset between the training runs so what was the point of saying that it was stateful. I'm guessing this is related to the fact that training data is not shuffled, but I'm not sure how.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?

<h2>Edit 1:</h2>

<p>A bit confused about @van's comment about the red and green boxes being equal. So just to confirm, does the following API calls correspond to the unrolled diagrams? Especially noting the second diagram (<code>batch_size</code> was arbitrarily chosen.):

<h2>Edit 2:</h2>

<p>For people who have done Udacity's deep learning course and still confused about the time_step argument, look at the following discussion: <a href=""https://discussions.udacity.com/t/rnn-lstm-use-implementation/163169"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://discussions.udacity.com/t/rnn-lstm-use-implementation/163169</a></p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>It turns out <code>model.add(TimeDistributed(Dense(vocab_len)))</code> was what I was looking for. Here is an example: <a href=""https://github.com/sachinruk/ShakespeareBot"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/sachinruk/ShakespeareBot</a></p>

<p>Many times we need to auto-fit the font of the TextView to the boundaries given to it.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Sadly, even though there are many threads and posts (and suggested solutions) talking about this problem (example <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2617266/how-to-adjust-text-font-size-to-fit-textview"">here</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5033012/auto-scale-textview-text-to-fit-within-bounds"">here</a> and <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ankri/autoscaletextview/src"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), none of them actually work well.</p>

<p>That's why, I've decided to test each of them till I find the real deal.</p>

<p>I think that the requirements from such a textView should be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Should allow using any font, typeface, style, and set of characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Should handle both width and height</p></li>
<li><p>No truncation unless text cannot fit because of the limitation, we've
given to it (example: too long text, too small available size). However, we could request for horizontal/vertical scrollbar if we wish, just for those cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Should allow multi-line or single-line. In case of multi-line, allow max &amp; min lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Should not be slow in computation. Using a loop for finding the best size? At least optimize it and don't increment your sampling by 1 each time.</p></li>
<li><p>In case of multi-line, should allow to prefer resizing or using more lines, and/or allow to choose the lines ourselves by using the ""\n"" character.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>What I've tried</h2>

<p>I've tried so many samples (including those of the links, I've written about), and I've also tried to modify them to handle the cases, I've talked about, but none really work.</p>

<p>I've made a sample project that allows me to visually see if the TextView auto-fits correctly.</p>

<p>Currently, my sample project only randomize the text (the English alphabet plus digits) and the size of the textView, and let it stay with single line, but even this doesn't work well on any of the samples I've tried.</p>

<p>Does anybody know of a solution for this common problem that actually work?</p>

<p>Even a solution that has much less features that what I've written about, for example one that has just a constant number of lines of text, and adjusts its font according to its size, yet never have weird glitches and having the text get too large/small compared to its available space.</p>

Traditionally, it has always been of utmost importance to check your allocs, copies and retains to make sure each has a corresponding release message.</p>

<p>The toolchain that comes with Xcode 4.2 introduces automatic reference counting (ARC) with the latest version of the <a href=""http://llvm.org"">LLVM compiler</a>, that totally does away with this problem by getting the compiler to memory-manage your stuff for you. That's pretty cool, and it does cut lots of unnecessary, mundane development time and prevent a lot of careless memory leaks that are easy to fix with proper retain/release balance. Even autorelease pools need to be managed differently when you enable ARC for your Mac and iOS apps (as you shouldn't allocate your own <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code>s anymore).</p>

<p>But what <em>other</em> memory leaks does it <em>not</em> prevent that I still have to watch out for?</p>

<p>I've settled on Diablo 2. Game play is thus in real-time and from an isometric viewpoint, with the player controlling a single avatar whom the camera is centered on. </p>

<p>To make things concrete, the task is to get your character x experience points without having its health drop to 0, where experience point are gained through killing monsters. Here is an example of the gameplay:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/2NslT.jpg"" alt=""here""></p>

<p>Now, since I want the net to operate based solely on the information it gets from the pixels on the screen, it must learn a very rich representation in order to play efficiently, since this would presumably require it to know (implicitly at least) how divide the game world up into objects and how to interact with them.</p>

<p>And all of this information must be taught to the net... somehow. I can't for the life of me think of how to train this thing. My only idea is have a separate program visually extract something innately good/bad in the game (e.g. health, gold, experience) from the screen, and then use that stat in a reinforcement learning procedure. I think that will be <em>part</em> of the answer, but I don't think it'll be enough; there are just too many levels of abstraction from raw visual input to goal-oriented behavior for such limited feedback to train a net within my lifetime.</p>

<p>So, my question: what other ways can you think of to train a net to do at least some part of this task? preferably without making thousands of labeled examples...</p>

<p>Just for a little more direction: I'm looking for some other sources of reinforcement learning and/or any unsupervised methods for extracting useful information in this setting. Or a supervised algorithm if you can think of a way of getting labeled data out of a game world without having to manually label it.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE(04/27/12):</strong></p>

<p>Strangely, I'm still working on this and seem to be making progress. The biggest secret to getting a ANN controller to work is to use the most advanced ANN architectures appropriate to the task. Hence I've been using a <a href=""http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Deep_belief_networks"" rel=""noreferrer"">deep belief net</a> composed of factored <a href=""http://cs.nyu.edu/~gwtaylor/thesis/4/"" rel=""noreferrer"">conditional restricted Boltzmann machines</a> that I've trained in an unsupervised manner (on video of me playing the game) before fine tuning with <a href=""http://www.stanford.edu/group/pdplab/pdphandbook/handbookch10.html#x26-1290009"" rel=""noreferrer"">temporal difference back-propagation</a> (i.e. reinforcement learning with standard feedforward ANNs).</p>

<p><em>Still looking for more valuable input though, especially on the problem of action selection in real-time and how to encode color images for ANN processing :-)</em> </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE(10/21/15):</strong></p>

<p>Just remembered I asked this question back-in-the-day, and thought I should mention that this is no longer a crazy idea. Since my last update, DeepMind published their nature <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/abs/nature14236.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">paper on getting neural networks to play atari games from visual inputs</a>. Indeed, the  only thing preventing me from using their architecture to play, a limited subset, of Diablo 2 is the lack of access to the underlying game engine. Rendering to the screen and then redirecting it to the network is just far too slow to train in a reasonable amount of time. Thus we probably won't see this sort of bot playing Diablo 2 anytime soon, but only because it'll be playing something either open-source or with API access to the rendering target. (quake perhaps?)</p>

It's like we plug something into something else. He mentioned an example about EJB 2.0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example the Session Bean interface
  defines ejbRemove, ejbPassivate
  (stored to secondary storage), and
  ejbActivate (restored from passive
  state). You don't get to control when
  these methods are called, just what
  they do. The container calls us, we
  don't call it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads to the difference between framework and library:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inversion of Control is a key part of
  what makes a framework different to a
  library. A library is essentially a
  set of functions that you can call,
  these days usually organized into
  classes. Each call does some work and
  returns control to the client.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think, the point of view that DI is IOC, means the dependency of an object is inverted: instead it controls its own dependencies, life cycle... something else does it for you. But, as you told me about DI by hands, DI is not necessarily IOC. We can still have DI and no IOC.</p>

<p>However, in this paper (from the pococapsule, another IOC Framework for C/C++), it suggests that because of IOC and DI, the IOC containers and DI frameworks are far more superior to J2EE, since J2EE mixes the framework code into the components, thus not making it Plain Old Java/C++ Object (POJO/POCO).</p>

<p><strong>Inversion of Control Containers other than the Dependency Injection pattern</strong>: <a href=""http://www.pocomatic.com/docs/whitepapers/ioc-vs-di/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.pocomatic.com/docs/whitepapers/ioc-vs-di/</a></p>

<p><strong>My Question</strong>: What's exactly is IOC and DI? I am confused. Based on pococapsule, IOC is something more significant than just invert the control of objects or between programmers and frameworks.</p>

(Resources I've read, understand, and agree with: <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet"" rel=""noreferrer"">OWASP CSRF Prevention CHeat Sheet</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9632262/questions-about-csrf"">Questions about CSRF</a>.)</p>

<p>As I understand it, the vulnerability around CSRF is introduced by the assumption that (from the webserver's point of view) a valid session cookie in an incoming HTTP request reflects the wishes of an authenticated user. But all cookies for the origin domain are magically attached to the request by the browser, so really all the server can infer from the presence of a valid session cookie in a request is that the request comes from a browser which has an authenticated session; it cannot further assume anything about the <em>code</em> running in that browser, or whether it really reflects user wishes. The way to prevent this is to include additional authentication information (the ""CSRF token"") in the request, carried by some means other than the browser's automatic cookie handling. Loosely speaking, then, the session cookie authenticates the user/browser and the CSRF token authenticates the code running in the browser.</p>

<p>So in a nutshell, if you're using a session cookie to authenticate users of your web application, you should also add a CSRF token to each response, and require a matching CSRF token in each (mutating) request. The CSRF token then makes a roundtrip from server to browser back to server, proving to the server that the page making the request is approved by (generated by, even) that server.</p>

<p>On to my question, which is about the specific transport method used for that CSRF token on that roundtrip.</p>

<p>It seems common (e.g. in <a href=""http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http"" rel=""noreferrer"">AngularJS</a>, <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/csrf/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Django</a>, <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#csrf-countermeasures"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rails</a>) to send the CSRF token from server to client as a cookie (i.e. in a Set-Cookie header), and then have Javascript in the client scrape it out of the cookie and attach it as a separate XSRF-TOKEN header to send back to the server.</p>

<p>(An alternate method is the one recommended by e.g. <a href=""http://dailyjs.com/2012/09/13/express-3-csrf-tutorial/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Express</a>, where the CSRF token generated by the server is included in the response body via server-side template expansion, attached directly to the code/markup that will supply it back to the server, e.g. as a hidden form input. That example is a more web 1.0-ish way of doing things, but would generalize fine to a more JS-heavy client.)</p>

<p>Why is it so common to use Set-Cookie as the downstream transport for the CSRF token / why is this a good idea? I imagine the authors of all these frameworks considered their options carefully and didn't get this wrong. But at first glance, using cookies to work around what's essentially a design limitation on cookies seems daft. In fact, if you used cookies as the roundtrip transport (Set-Cookie: header downstream for the server to tell the browser the CSRF token, and Cookie: header upstream for the browser to return it to the server) you would reintroduce the vulnerability you are trying to fix.</p>

<p>I realize that the frameworks above don't use cookies for the whole roundtrip for the CSRF token; they use Set-Cookie downstream, then something else (e.g. a X-CSRF-Token header) upstream, and this does close off the vulnerability. But even using Set-Cookie as the downstream transport is potentially misleading and dangerous; the browser will now attach the CSRF token to every request including genuine malicious XSRF requests; at best that makes the request bigger than it needs to be and at worst some well-meaning but misguided piece of server code might actually try to use it, which would be really bad. And further, since the actual intended recipient of the CSRF token is client-side Javascript, that means this cookie can't be protected with http-only. So sending the CSRF token downstream in a Set-Cookie header seems pretty suboptimal to me.</p>

The second solution seems the best choice. The third I don't wish to follow because it seems that many things could go wrong and I can't test it in every aspect. I'm having a hard time refactoring my project to perform atomic operations. I don't know whether this comes from my limited viewpoint (I have only worked with SQL databases so far), or whether it actually can't be done.</p>

<p>We would like to pilot test MongoDB at our company. We have chosen a relatively simple project - an SMS gateway. It allows our software to send SMS messages to the cellular network and the gateway does the dirty work: actually communicating with the providers via different communication protocols. The gateway also manages the billing of the messages. Every customer who applies for the service has to buy some credits. The system automatically decreases the user's balance when a message is sent and denies the access if the balance is insufficient. Also because we are customers of third party SMS providers, we may also have our own balances with them. We have to keep track of those as well.</p>

<p>I started thinking about how I can store the required data with MongoDB if I cut down some complexity (external billing, queued SMS sending). Coming from the SQL world, I would create a separate table for users, another one for SMS messages, and one for storing the transactions regarding the users' balance. Let's say I create separate collections for all of those in MongoDB.</p>

<p>Imagine an SMS sending task with the following steps in this simplified system:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>check if the user has sufficient balance; deny access if there's not enough credit</p></li>
<li><p>send and store the message in the SMS collection with the details and cost (in the live system the message would have a <code>status</code> attribute and a task would pick up it for delivery and set the price of the SMS according to its current state)</p></li>
<li><p>decrease the users's balance by the cost of the sent message</p></li>
<li><p>log the transaction in the transaction collection</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now what's the problem with that? MongoDB can do atomic updates only on one document. In the previous flow it could happen that some kind of error creeps in and the message gets stored in the database but the user's balance is not updated and/or the transaction is not logged.</p>

<p>I came up with two ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a single collection for the users, and store the balance as a field, user related transactions and messages as sub documents in the user's document. Because we can update documents atomically, this actually solves the transaction problem. Disadvantages: if the user sends many SMS messages, the size of the document could become large and the 4MB document limit could be reached. Maybe I can create history documents in such scenarios, but I don't think this would be a good idea. Also I don't know how fast the system would be if I  push more and more data to the same big document.</p></li>
<li><p>Create one collection for users, and one for transactions. There can be two kinds of transactions: <em>credit purchase</em> with positive balance change and <em>messages sent</em> with negative balance change. Transaction may have a subdocument; for example in <em>messages sent</em> the details of the SMS can be embedded in the transaction. Disadvantages: I don't store the current user balance so I have to calculate it every time a user tries to send a message to tell if the message could go through or not. I'm afraid this calculation can became slow as the number of stored transactions grows.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm a little bit confused about which method to pick. Are there other solutions? I couldn't find any best practices online about how to work around these kinds of problems. I guess many programmers who are trying to become familiar with the NoSQL world are facing similar problems in the beginning.</p>

<pre><code>[
    { Phase: ""Phase 1"", Value: 50 },
    { Phase: ""Phase 2"", Value: 130 }

<p>And if I did groupy <code>Phase</code> / <code>Step</code>, I’d receive:</p>

    { Phase: ""Phase 1"", Step: ""Step 2"", Value: 35 },

    { Phase: ""Phase 2"", Step: ""Step 2"", Value: 75 }

<p>Is there a helpful script for this, or should I stick to using Underscore.js, and then looping through the resulting object to do the totals myself?</p>

If it's to access a service, such as Dropbox or YouTube, or for logging crashes. The number of third party libraries and services is staggering. Most of those libraries and services are integrated by somehow authenticating with the service, most of the time, this happens through an API key. For security purposes, services usually generate a public and private, often also referred to as secret, key. Unfortunately, in order to connect to the services, this private key must be used to authenticate and hence, probably be part of the application. 
Needless to say, that this faces in immense security problem. Public and private API keys can be extracted from APKs in a matter of minutes and can easily be automated. </p>

<p>With <code>() =&gt; {}</code> and <code>function () {}</code> we are getting two very similar ways to write functions in ES6. In other languages lambda functions often distinguish themselves by being anonymous, but in ECMAScript any function can be anonymous. Each of the two types have unique usage domains (namely when <code>this</code> needs to either be bound explicitly or explicitly not be bound). Between those domains there is a vast number of cases where either notation will do.</p>

<p>Arrow functions in ES6 have at least two limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't work with <code>new</code></li>
<li>Fixed <code>this</code> bound to scope at initialisation</li>
</ul>

<p>These two limitations aside, arrow functions could theoretically replace regular functions almost anywhere. What is the right approach using them in practice? Should arrow functions be used e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li>""everywhere they work"", i.e. everywhere a function does not have to be agnostic about the <code>this</code> variable and we are not creating an object.</li>
<li>only ""everywhere they are needed"", i.e. event listeners, timeouts, that need to be bound to a certain scope</li>
<li>with 'short' functions but not with 'long' functions</li>
<li>only with functions that do not contain another arrow function</li>
</ul>

<p>What I am looking for is a guideline to selecting the appropriate function notation in the future version of ECMAScript. The guideline will need to be clear, so that it can be taught to developers in a team, and to be consistent so that it does not require constant refactoring back and forth from one function notation to another.</p>

<p>I have the first list created trough a loop function, that will get specific lines out of a file and will save them in a list.</p>

<p>Then a second list is used to save these lines, and start a new cycle over another file.</p>

<p>My idea was to get the list once that the for cycle is done, dump it into the second list, then start a new cycle, dump the content of the first list again into the second but appending it, so the second list will be the sum of all the smaller list files created in my loop. The list has to be append only if certain conditions met. </p>

<p>It looks like something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code># This is done for each log in my directory, i have a loop running
for logs in mydir:

    for line in mylog:
        #...if the conditions are met
        list1.append(line)

    for item in list1:
        if ""string"" in item: #if somewhere in the list1 i have a match for a string
            list2.append(list1) # append every line in list1 to list2

            break
        else:
            del list1 [:] # delete the list content and start all over

<p>Does this makes sense or should I go for a different route?</p>

<p>I need something efficient that would not take up too many cycles, since the list of logs is long and each text file is pretty big; so I thought that the lists would fit the purpose.</p>

<p>There are two branches, one called <strong>master</strong> and one called <strong>mobiledevicesupport</strong>. I want to keep mobiledevicesupport as a continuous branch that will be merged/synced with the master branch whenever mobiledevicesupport is stable. This would merge changes from mobiledevicesupport into master but also bring all the changes from master into mobiledevicesupport so that branch can continue to be worked on and the features improved or amended. This needs to work with a central repository and multiple developers.</p>

<p>Please an example of similar workflows other people use or just tell me if this idea is stupid and I should consider other options. At the moment the workflow seems sound, but I just don't know how I can make git work this way.</p>

<p>Thanks, all help much appreciated.</p>

<p>Update 1:
If I was to merge master into mobiledevicesupport and mobiledevice support into master, do I get replicated commits across both branches. Or is git smart enough to work out that I have pulled the latest changes from branch A into branch B and add merge commit C to branch B. And I have pulled the latest changes from branch B into branch A and add merge commit D to branch A?</p>

<p>I was going to post an image but I don't have enough reputation for it, so I guess the following illustration will have to do. Two branches continuously running with merges going both directions often. The key thing I am not sure about is how git will play out the commits and will it fill either branch with the commits from the other branch on merges or will it stay clean. I have used rebase before but it seems to end the branch and put all the commits into the master, or I did it wrong. Thanks for the help so far.</p>

But one thing that occurred to me is that people often use pointers to objects rather than the objects themselves, for example this declaration:</p>

<pre><code>Object *myObject = new Object;
</code></pre>

<p>rather than:</p>

<pre><code>Object myObject;
</code></pre>

<p>Or instead of using a function, let's say <code>testFunc()</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>myObject.testFunc();
</code></pre>

<p>we have to write:</p>

<pre><code>myObject-&gt;testFunc();

<p>But I can't figure out why should we do it this way. I would assume it has to do with efficiency and speed since we get direct access to the memory address. Am I right?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></p>

<p>I have tried an approach similar to what I have done for <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10564/how-can-i-set-up-an-editor-to-work-with-git-on-windows"">Notepad++ in the past</a>, i.e.</p>

<p>And used:</p>

<p>The original question was about an issue specific to VS2015 CTP6 with the XUnit test runner. It's clear from the answers that there is a much broader issue with unit test discovery in Visual Studio which may occur in many different situations. I have cleaned up my question to reflect that.</p>

<p>I have also included a script in my own answer that I still use to this day to solve similar problems when they appear.</p>

<p>Many other answers have also proven helpful in better understanding the intricacies of the VS test runner. I appreciate that people are still sharing their solutions!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Original question 2015-04-10:</strong></p>

<p>Since yesterday, my Visual Studio Test Explorer won't discover tests for any of my projects. It does not show the green loading bar after building, either.</p>

<p>When I go to the Visual Studio Test Explorer and click ""Run All"", or when I right-click any test method and select ""Run Tests"", I get the following in my output window:</p>

<p><code>Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.ProjectSystem, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.</code></p>

<p>I am running Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6 on Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview, build 10041. The .NET Framework version does not seem to matter - it happens on <code>4.0</code>, <code>4.5.2</code> and <code>4.6</code>.</p>

<p>I tried with the following testing frameworks and all of them give the same behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework v14.0.22609.0</code></li>
<li><code>xunit v2.1.0-beta1-build2945</code> with <code>xunit.runner.visualstudio v2.1.0-beta1-build1051</code></li>
<li><code>NUnit v2.6.4</code> with <code>NUnitTestAdapter v2.0.0</code></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I found an issue on GitHub (xunit) that appeared to be similar: <a href=""https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/295"">Cannot get tests discovered #295</a>, with this comment from the xunit team:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be aware that Visual Studio 2015 CTP 5 has been reported to be broken
  by many people with unit testing in general (not just xUnit.net), so
  don't expect that to work.</p>
  
  <p>Also, please make sure you've cleaned out Visual Studio's runner
  cache. If it gets corrupted, Visual Studio will permanently misbehave
  until it's deleted. To clear the cache, shut down all instances of
  Visual Studio, then delete the folder
  %TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions (honestly, it probably
  wouldn't hurt to delete everything in %TEMP% that can be deleted).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tried their suggestion to delete the folder <code>%TEMP%\VisualStudioTestExplorerExtensions</code>. Unfortunately that did not fix the problem.</p>

<p>I noticed that ReSharper actually <strong>is</strong> able to discover some tests. It only works for the VS and NUnit tests, not for xunit.</p>

<p>There has to be some sort of temp or cache folder I need to clear, but I know Visual Studio has many of them and not all of them can be deleted without unwanted side-effects.</p>

<p>and it is running alright. I have got what I wanted.

<p>I found a useful chart here: <a href=""http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm</a> . With this data I managed to come up with this:</p>

80% = #128
90% = #144

<p><strong>How are these mipmap images different from the other familiar drawable images?</strong></p>

<h2>References:</h2>

<p>The <a href=""https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Android 4.3 APIs</a> document has the following to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using a mipmap as the source for your bitmap or drawable is a simple
  way to provide a quality image and various image scales, which can be
  particularly useful if you expect your image to be scaled during an
  animation.</p>
  
  <p>Android 4.2 (API level 17) added support for mipmaps in the Bitmap
  class—Android swaps the mip images in your Bitmap when you've supplied
  a mipmap source and have enabled setHasMipMap(). Now in Android 4.3,
  you can enable mipmaps for a BitmapDrawable object as well, by
  providing a mipmap asset and setting the android:mipMap attribute in a
  bitmap resource file or by calling hasMipMap().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see anything in there that helps me to understand.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/drawable-resource.html#Bitmap"" rel=""noreferrer"">XML Bitmap resources</a> have an <code>android:mipMap</code> property:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boolean. Enables or disables the mipmap hint. See setHasMipMap() for
  more information. Default value is false.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This does not apply to launcher icons as far as I can see.</p>

<hr>

<p>The question was raised on Google Groups (<em><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-developers/ZUyF0JEwibs"" rel=""noreferrer"">The purpose of resource name ""mipmap""?!</a></em>), to which Romain Guy replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's useful to provide an image at a larger resolution that would
  normally be computed (for instance, on an mdpi device, Launcher might
  want the larger hdpi icon to display large app shortcuts.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like this almost makes sense of it, but not quite.</p>

<p>I'm still inclined to go with Randy Sugianto's follow up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are the advantages of this? Is there any guide how to use
  mipmaps, probably for better launcher icons?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Of course, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia has a page for ""Mipmap""</a>, which refers to an older technique invented in 1983, that I can't quite relate to the current Android implementation.</p>

<hr>

<p>Should we be storing all our <strong>app icons in <code>res/mipmap</code> folders</strong> these days, and what are the <strong>guidelines</strong> for these mipmap images?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update #1</strong></p>

<p>Here's a blog post that tries to explain it a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://programmium.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/mipmapping-for-drawables-in-android-4-3/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mipmapping for drawables in Android 4.3</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But the image used in that blog post shows what looks like one file with many logos in it. This is not what I see in Chrome's mipmap folder.</p>

<p>Chrome's <code>mipmap-hdpi</code> folder contains three images. One is the Chrome logo, on its own.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/o75PM.png"" alt=""Chrome mipmap-hdpi icon.png""></p>

<p>Strangely, it is 72x72, not 48x48 which I would expect to see.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is all there is to this - we just need to keep bigger icons in the mipmap folders?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update #2</strong></p>

<p>The Android Developers Blog post of 23/10/2014 again confirms the idea of using the <code>mipmap</code> folders for application icons:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2014/10/getting-your-apps-ready-for-nexus-6-and.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Getting Your Apps Ready for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When talking about the Nexus 6 screen density, the author writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the
  drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from
  the device’s current density. For example, an xxxhdpi app icon can be
  used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update #3</strong></p>

<p>Note that Android Studio creates the <code>ic_launcher.png</code> icons in the <code>mipmap...</code> folders rather than the <code>drawable...</code> folders that Eclipse used to create them in.</p>

<p>Objective-C is a platform-independent language, whereas Swift is platform-dependent. Writing non-platform-dependent code (business logic libraries) in Swift would thus not be wise. However, writing platform-dependent code in it (interface related for example) would be perfectly fine. Not to say it would be a good idea, however it is definitely an interest.</p>

When Bob registers on our website, our API gateway needs to create a user through the User microservice and a wallet through the Wallet microservice. </p>

<p>Now here are a few scenarios where things could go wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>User Bob creation fails: that's OK, we just return an error message to the Bob. We're using SQL transactions so no one ever saw Bob in the system. Everything's good :)</p></li>
<li><p>User Bob is created but before our Wallet can be created, our API gateway hard crashes. We now have a User with no wallet (inconsistent data).</p></li>
<li><p>User Bob is created and as we are creating the Wallet, the HTTP connection drops. The wallet creation might have succeeded or it might have not.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>What solutions are available to prevent this kind of data inconsistency from happening? Are there patterns that allow transactions to span multiple REST requests? I've read the Wikipedia page on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol"">Two-phase commit</a> which seems to touch on this issue but I'm not sure how to apply it in practice. This <a href=""http://ws-rest.org/2014/sites/default/files/wsrest2014_submission_7.pdf"">Atomic Distributed Transactions: a RESTful design</a> paper also seems interesting although I haven't read it yet.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I know REST might just not be suited for this use case. Would perhaps the correct way to handle this situation to drop REST entirely and use a different communication protocol like a message queue system? Or should I enforce consistency in my application code (for example, by having a background job that detects inconsistencies and fixes them or by having a ""state"" attribute on my User model with ""creating"", ""created"" values, etc.)?</p>

Invalid item position","<android><android-layout><android-recyclerview><screen-rotation>","<p>Our QA has detected a bug: when rotating the Android device (Droid Turbo), the following RecyclerView-related crash happened:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Inconsistency detected. Invalid item position 2(offset:2).state:3
</code></pre>

<p>To me it looks like an internal error inside RecyclerView, as I can't think of any way of this being caused directly by our code...</p>

<p>Has anyone encountered this problem?</p>

<p>What would be the solution?</p>

<p>A brutal workaround could be perhaps to catch the exception when it happens, and re-create the RecyclverView instance from scratch, to avoid getting left with a corrupted state.</p>

<p>But, if possible, I would like to understand the problem better (and perhaps fix it at its source), instead of masking it.</p>

<p>The bug is not easy to reproduce, but it is fatal when it happens.</p>

<p>Take this code:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {

    users.add(new User(1, ""User1""));

<p>This code finds a <code>User</code> based on their ID. But there are no guarantees how many <code>User</code>s matched the filter.</p>

<p>Changing the filter line to:</p>

<pre><code>User match = users.stream().filter((user) -&gt; user.getId() &lt; 0).findAny().get();

I'm comparing them both on a <strong>Windows 7 64 bit ultimate</strong> with <strong>16GB</strong> of ram and <strong>Intel i7 4770</strong> running NVidia Geforce 780 with the latest NVidia drivers if it matters and I'm running the latest JDK and the latest Android Studio.</p>

<p>The Android Studio is very slow in building the project which I can live with but it's also extremely resource intensive and sometimes slows down the PC to a crawl. </p>

<p>Whenever I'm building or running anything in AS, my PC seems to become extremely sluggish. It also causes flickering of screen and occasionally blanking my second monitor if I click on ""Gradle build running"" spinner which I find very odd. The RAM usage also shoots up to ~3GB which I find excessive for doing nothing (this is when it's idle after a few builds).</p>

<p>In addition, the panels at the bottom of AS keep jumping around which is a horrible user experience (moves from <code>Android</code> to <code>Messages</code> to <code>Version Control</code> or anything else on an ad-hoc basis depending on what's happening which is very, very annoying).</p>

<p>What I would like to know is basically:</p>

<p>1) How do I make Android Studio run better? I may be doing something wrong or missing some updates that I'm not aware of and I'm sure others have also noticed these behaviors and have found some solutions to it.</p>

<p>2) How do I ""pin"" the bottom panels so that they don't jump around and instead, let me, the user, navigate to them when I wish to instead of automatically switching them?</p>

<p>Many thanks and my apologies again if it's not the correct place for these questions.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1</strong>
Some more comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm using the latest <code>stable</code> build as of today. The build is <code>Android Studio 1.2.2 Build # AI-141.1980579, Build on June 3, 2015</code></li>
<li>The behavior happens when using either Java 7 or 8. It doesn't appear to be related to the version of Java.</li>
<li>I am not using Presentation Mode. Just the vanilla view.</li>
<li>Doing the changes to the build configuration (thanks to @Blackbelt and his answer) appears to have helped with the build but the other problems with sluggishness and general user experience remain.</li>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JiZCa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In case the user declines an important permission, imo an app should display an explanation why the permission is needed and what impact declining has. That dialog has two options: 1) re-try again (permission is requested again), 2) deny (app will work without that permission).</p>

<p>If the user checks ""Never ask again"" however, the second dialog with the explanation shouldn't be shown, especially if the user already declined once before.
Now the question is: how does my app know whether the user has checked the ""Never ask again""? IMO the onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) doesn't give me that information.</p>

<p>A second question would be: does Google have plans to incorporate a custom message in the permission dialog that would explain why the app needs the permission? That way there would never be a second dialog which would certainly make for a better ux.</p>

<p>1) What are SSE4.2 and AVX?</p>

<p>2) How do these SSE4.2 and AVX improve CPU computations for Tensorflow tasks.</p>

<p>I was thinking of many ways to handle this issue, but haven't yet found any good ones. (For example: create a <code>ClassConfig</code> handler, and pass a <code>parameter</code> object, which is declared separately from the class. Then the handler would attach to the class.
